AB  - Specific sequences in RNA preparations can be detected by blotting and
      hybridization analysis using techniques very similar to those originally
      developed for DNA. Fractionated RNA is transferred from an agarose gel to a
      membrane support (northern blotting); unfractionated RNA is immobilized by slot
      or dot blotting. The resulting blots are studied by hybridization analysis with
      labeled DNA or RNA probes. Northern blotting differs from Southern blotting
      largely in the initial gel fractionation step. Because they are single-stranded, 
      most RNAs are able to form secondary structures by intramolecular base pairing
      and must therefore be electrophoresed under denaturing conditions if good
      separations are to be obtained. Denaturation is achieved either by adding
      formaldehyde to the gel and loading buffers or by treating the RNA with glyoxal
      and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) prior to loading. The Basic Protocol describes
      blotting and hybridization of RNA fractionated in an agarose-formaldehyde gel.
      Alternate Protocols describe the glyoxal/DMSO method for denaturing gel
      electrophoresis and slot-blot hybridization of RNA samples. Stripping
      hybridization probes from blots can be done under three different sets of
      conditions; these methods are outlined in a Support Protocol.

TI  - miR-122, a mammalian liver-specific microRNA, is processed from hcr mRNA and may 
      downregulate the high affinity cationic amino acid transporter CAT-1.
PG  - 106-13
AB  - These studies show that miR-122, a 22-nucleotide microRNA, is derived from a
      liver-specific noncoding polyadenylated RNA transcribed from the gene hcr. The
      exact sequence of miR-122 as well as the adjacent secondary structure within the 
      hcr mRNA are conserved from mammalian species back to fish. Levels of miR-122 in 
      the mouse liver increase to half maximal values around day 17 of embryogenesis,
      and reach near maximal levels of 50,000 copies per average cell before birth.
      Lewis et al. (2003) predicted the cationic amino acid transporter (CAT-1 or
      SLC7A1) as a miR-122 target. CAT-1 protein and its mRNA are expressed in all
      mammalian tissues but with lower levels in adult liver. Furthermore, during mouse
      liver development CAT-1 mRNA decreases in an almost inverse correlation with
      miR-122. Eight potential miR-122 target sites were predicted within the human
      CAT-1 mRNA, with six in the 3'-untranslated region. Using a reporter construct it
      was found that just three of the predicted sites, linked in a 400-nucleotide
      sequence from human CAT-1, acted with synergy and were sufficient to strongly
      inhibit protein synthesis and reduce mRNA levels. In summary, these studies
      followed the accumulation during development of miR-122 from its mRNA precursor, 
      hcr, through to identification of what may be a specific mRNA target, CAT-1.

TI  - Transcriptome analysis using fluorescence-labeled oligonucleotide.
PG  - 301-2
AB  - In our previous studies, the fluorescence intensity at 480 nm of the
      bispyrene-labeled 2'-O-methyl-oligoribonucleotide (OMUpy2) was drastically
      enhanced only when it was hybridized with its complementary RNA. In this study,
      we demonstrated the potential of the OMUpy2 for transcriptome analysis in the
      cell free system and in the living cell. For the analysis in the cell free
      system, the micro-chamber was designed and used to evaluate the detection limit
      of the target RNA. The detection limit of oligo-RNA was approximately 15 fmol.
      For the analysis of the living cells, C-OMUpy2 was introduced to the cervical
      carcinoma cells, C4II, and the fluorescence from C-OMUpy2 was monitored. The
      fluorescence from the cells began to be observed 5 min after the serum
      stimulation, and the fluorescence was decreased after 20 min. These results
      seemed to be consistent with the results from the RT-PCR analysis and suggested
      that OMUpy2 could be a useful tool for the transcriptome analysis.

TI  - Mouse microRNA-23b regulates expression of Hes1 gene in P19 cells.
PG  - 213-4
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are abundant class of approximately 21-25 nts small endogenous
      RNAs. Recently several hundred miRNAs have been identified from diverse species; 
      nematodes, insects, plants, and animals. These small RNAs can regulate gene
      expression at a post-transcriptional level by interacting with their target
      mRNAs. Interaction of these RNAs causes either repression of translation or
      RNAi-dependent cleavage of target RNAs. It has been recently found that they have
      critical regulatory roles in embryogenesis, development, differentiation,
      cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and so on. However, identifications of the
      target of the target of miRNAs have been almost unknown, especially in
      vertebrates. Here we show that Hairy/enhancer of split protein (Hes1), a bHLH
      transcriptional repressor functioning in neuronal differentiation, is a target of
      mouse miRNA-23b (miR-23b).

TI  - MicroRNA-196 inhibits HOXB8 expression in myeloid differentiation of HL60 cells.
PG  - 211-2
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small RNAs (approximately 21-25 nts) that can
      regulate gene expression at a post-transcriptional level. Recently a large number
      of miRNAs have been identified from plants and animals. In addition, it has been 
      reported that these small RNAs can participate in cell differentiation of
      developmental timing. In this study, we show that microRNA-196 (miR-196) inhibits
      HOXB8 expression in myeloid differentiation of HL 60 cells. MiR-196 has perfect
      complementarity with target sequence of 3'-UTR in HOXB8 mRNA. Exogenous expressed
      miR-196 repressed expression of HOXB8 via cleaving mRNAs. Moreover miR-196
      enhanced myeloid differentiation of HL60 cells. These results suggest that
      miR-196 participates in myeloid differentiation of HL60 cells via regulation of
      HOXB8 expression.

TI  - [Novel methods to detect cytokines by enzyme-linked oligonucleotide assay].
PG  - 679-82
AB  - The development of the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment 
      (SELEX) process has made it possible to isolate oligonucleotide sequences with
      the capacity of recognizing virtually any class of target molecules with high
      affinity and specificity. These oligonucleotide sequences, referred to as
      "aptamers", are useful as a class of molecules that rival antibodies in
      diagnostic applications. Aptamers are different from antibodies, yet they mimic
      properties of antibodies in a variety of diagnostic formats. To meet the
      shortcomings of antibodies, aptamers have the following advantages. Aptamer does 
      not depend on animals, cells, or even in vivo conditions and produced by chemical
      synthesis with extreme accuracy and reproducibility. Once denatured, functional
      aptamers could be regenerated easily within minutes. They are stable to long-term
      storage and can be transported at ambient temperature. We describe here an enzyme
      -linked oligonucleotide assay that use a SELEX-derived RNA aptamer to detect
      hTNFalpha. In order to protect from nuclease attack, the RNA aptamer was modified
      by replacement of 2'-NH2 for 2'-OH at all ribo-purines. In a sandwich micro-plate
      assay, hTNFalpha monoclonal antibody was coated on the surface of the plate,
      biotin-labeled RNA aptamer was used as a detect molecle. HTNFalpha was diluted by
      pooled human serum as standard, and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase-substrate
      system was added for detection. Accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity of 
      ELONA method were analyzed. The levels of hTNF-alpha in normal human serum
      samples were assayed by the ELONA and the ELISA processes. The resultes
      demonstrate that a sandwich assay using a SELEX-derived RNA aptamer has
      parameters for accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity well within the
      limits expected of a typical enzyme-linked assay. There is no significant
      difference between the results of ELONA and ELISA. The minimum detection level
      was 100 pg/mL. This method will be useful for detection of almost all the
      cytokines and other protein molecules.

TI  - [Overexpression of thymosin beta4 in the cochlea of senescence-accelerated
      mouse].
PG  - 717-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop gene expression profiles of young and old
      senescence-accelerated mouse (SAM) cochlea and identify genes responsible for
      aging-related hearing loss. METHODS: Gene micro-array slides containing 1101
      mouse genes were hybridized to cDNA micro-arrays (Atlas Glass Array Mouse 1.0)
      that were synthesized using total RNAs from the cochlea of 2 mounts and 12 mounts
      mouse. Hybridization signals were visualized with cyanine-3 fluorescent reporter 
      molecules, and the fluorescence intensities of the images were analyzed.
      Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to
      validate the micro-array results. Immunofluorescence was used to identify the
      located region of the protein encoding by the candidate gene in the cochlea.
      RESULTS: Expression of a majority of the 1101 genes represented on the
      micro-array slides was not altered during aging; nonetheless, changes in the
      expression of 3 genes were detected between young and old mouse cochlea. RT-PCR
      results confirmed the changes in expression of thymosin beta4 of 3 genes
      examined. Through the using of immunofluorescence, it was shown that thymosin
      beta4 was primarily located in the tectorial membrane and the supporting cells of
      outer hair cell. CONCLUSIONS: Using commercially available slide micro-arrays,
      the results show that aging of the mouse cochlea is associated with changes in
      patterns of gene expression. This analysis suggests that thymosin beta4 may play 
      a role in aging-related hearing loss. These studies lay the foundation for future
      studies defining the genetic basis of aging-related hearing loss.

PG  - 155-61
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that serve fundamental biological
      roles across eukaryotic species. We describe a new method for high-throughput
      miRNA detection. The technique is termed the RNA-primed, array-based Klenow
      enzyme (RAKE) assay, because it involves on-slide application of the Klenow
      fragment of DNA polymerase I to extend unmodified miRNAs hybridized to
      immobilized DNA probes. We used RAKE to study human cell lines and brain tumors. 
      We show that the RAKE assay is sensitive and specific for miRNAs and is ideally
      suited for rapid expression profiling of all known miRNAs. RAKE offers unique
      advantages for specificity over northern blots or other microarray-based
      expression profiling platforms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that miRNAs can be
      isolated and profiled from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue, which opens
      up new opportunities for analyses of small RNAs from archival human tissue. The
      RAKE assay is theoretically versatile and may be used for other applications,
      such as viral gene profiling.

TI  - A custom microarray platform for analysis of microRNA gene expression.
PG  - 47-53
AB  - MicroRNAs are short, noncoding RNA transcripts that post-transcriptionally
      regulate gene expression. Several hundred microRNA genes have been identified in 
      Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, plants and mammals. MicroRNAs have been
      linked to developmental processes in C. elegans, plants and humans and to cell
      growth and apoptosis in Drosophila. A major impediment in the study of microRNA
      function is the lack of quantitative expression profiling methods. To close this 
      technological gap, we have designed dual-channel microarrays that monitor
      expression levels of 124 mammalian microRNAs. Using these tools, we observed
      distinct patterns of expression among adult mouse tissues and embryonic stem
      cells. Expression profiles of staged embryos demonstrate temporal regulation of a
      large class of microRNAs, including members of the let-7 family. This microarray 
      technology enables comprehensive investigation of microRNA expression, and
      furthers our understanding of this class of recently discovered noncoding RNAs.

PG  - 669-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the expression of thymidine phosphorylase (TP), thymidylate
      synthase (TS) and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) mRNA in breast cancer and
      its correlation with prognosis. METHODS: Expression levels of TP, TS and DPD mRNA
      in 86 micro-selected breast cancer tissues and 9 normal breast tissues were
      detected by real-time quantitative PCR. RESULTS: The median expression levels of 
      TP, TS and DPD mRNA in tumor tissue and in normal tissues were 16.54, 0.38, 2.47 
      and 11.75, 0.25, 8.33, respectively, there were no significant differences (P
      >0.05). The expression levels of TP, TS and DPD mRNA showed no association with
      tumor size, lymph node metastasis, pathological grade and clinical stage, except 
      that of DPD showed a negative association with patients' ages. There was no
      significant difference in disease-free survival or overall survival between the
      patients with high and low TP or DPD mRNA levels. Disease-free survival tends to 
      be better in the patients with low TS mRNA level than those with high TS mRNA,
      but the difference was not significant (P=0.069), while the overall survival
      showed a statistically difference (59.00 month and 70.30 month) (P=0.0496).
      CONCLUSION: The expression level of TS mRNA may serve as a prognostic marker for 
      breast cancer patients.

TI  - Effects of dioxin on gene expression in female reproductive system in the rat.
PG  - 47-55
AB  - We analyzed the effects of a low dose of dioxin on gene expression in
      reproductive tissues or cells by microrepresentation differential analysis
      (micro-RDA) and DNA microarray analysis, and identified more than one hundred
      dioxin-sensitive genes in cultured rat granulosa cells, rat placentas and rat
      ovaries. It is well known that dioxin exerts effects mainly through Ah receptors 
      which recognize the xenobiotic responsive element (XRE) in the promoter region of
      target genes. The present data, however, indicate that a low dose of
      2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) induces or suppresses the expression
      of various genes, which have not been known as dioxin-sensitive. These data
      suggest that a low dose of dioxin has profound effects on the reproductive
      system.

TI  - Effect of the oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol on
      hypoxia-inducible factor-regulated gene expression in bovine blastocysts.
PG  - 665-73
AB  - In cattle embryos, development to the blastocyst stage is improved in the
      presence of 10 micro;m 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), an uncoupler of oxidative
      phosphorylation, coincident with an increase in glycolytic activity following
      embryonic genome activation. The present study examined redox-sensitive gene
      expression and embryo development in response to the addition of DNP
      post-compaction. 2,4-Dinitrophenol increased the expression of hypoxia-inducible 
      factor 1alpha and 2alpha (HIF1alpha, HIF2alpha) mRNA. Although HIF1alpha protein 
      remained undetectable in bovine blastocysts, HIF2alpha protein was localised
      within the nucleus of trophectoderm and inner cell mass (ICM) cells of
      blastocysts cultured in the presence or absence of DNP, with a slight increase in
      staining evident within the ICM in blastocysts cultured in the presence of DNP.
      However, the expression of GLUT1 and VEGF mRNA, genes known to be regulated by
      HIFs, was unaffected by the addition of DNP to the culture. Although the
      development of Grade 1 and 2 blastocysts was unaltered by the addition of DNP
      post compaction in the present study, a significant increase in the proportion of
      ICM cells was observed. Results indicate that 10 microm DNP improves the quality 
      of bovine embryos, coincident with increased HIF2alpha protein localisation
      within ICM cells and increased HIFalpha mRNA levels. Therefore, the results
      demonstrate redox-regulated expression of HIF2.

PG  - 355-67
AB  - We utilized mass spectrometry (MS) and bioinformatics to investigate the proteome
      of the anterior pituitary gland (AP). Subcellular fractions of APs from
      2-month-old male Golden Syrian hamsters were prepared for protein denaturation,
      treatment with trypsin and analyses utilizing micro liquid chromatography MS/MS
      and the database search software SEQUEST. In the nuclear, non-nuclear 100,000 x g
      and cytosolic fractions we identified 76, 52 and 52 different proteins,
      respectively. A total of 145 distinct proteins were detected. We identified
      growth hormone, prolactin, pro-opiomelanocortin, the alpha-subunit for the
      glycoprotein hormones, luteinizing hormone-beta and follicle-stimulating
      hormone-beta. Groups of other identified proteins included hormone processing,
      secretion granule associated, non-hormonal endoplasmic reticulum associated,
      calcium binding, protein kinase C associated histone and non-histone chromosomal 
      material, other RNA-binding, splicing factors, heterogeneous nuclear
      ribonucleoproteins, helicases, lamins, microfilament associated, microtubule
      associated, adenosine triphosphate and guanosine diphosphate associated,
      keratins, lysosomal, ribosomal, enzymes in glycolysis and the tricarboxylic and
      pentose phosphate paths, glutathione associated, transmethylation, catabolic and 
      unknown protein products as well as blood hemoglobins. Proteins previously not
      reported in the AP, such as fertility protein SP22, were identified. The proteins
      identified in the present study form a foundation for defining the proteome in
      normal adult male AP.

      density (MVD). METHODS: The ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3 was transplanted into 
      nude mice to form xenogeneic tumor. Mice were treated with rapamycin 4 mg/kg,
      sulindac 100 mg/(kg.d) and saline 200 microl respectively. Expression of
      HIF-1alpha and VEGF proteins and MVD were determined by immunohistochemistry. The
      mRNA of Glut1 and VEGF was studied by RT-PCR. RESULTS: The positive expression of
      HIF-1alpha and VEGF was moderate to strong, and MVD was high (31 +/- 8) in
      control group. In rapamycin treated group, the expression of HIF-1alpha was
      inhibited to weak positive or negative (P < 0.05), the VEGF protein and mRNA
      expression decreased (P < 0.05), MVD was also suppressed to a low level (13 +/-
      5). There was a significant correlation between HIF-1alpha expression and VEGF
      expression (by Spearman's coefficient r = 0.8264, P < 0.01), and MVD (r = 0.4842,
      P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: HIF-1alpha protein can regulate VEGF protein and its mRNA
      expressions. It correlates with MVD in ovarian tumor tissue.

AB  - Plant and animal genomes contain an abundance of small genes that produce RNAs of
      about 22 nucleotides in length, which was dubbed as microRNAs. These newly found 
      endogenous RNAs may participate in a wide range of genetic regulatory pathways
      and play an important role in the development. This paper is focused on the
      finding of the microRNAs, its mechanism and function, as well as the methods of

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are believed to play important roles in developmental and
      other cellular processes by hybridizing to complementary target mRNA transcripts.
      This results in either cleavage of the hybridized transcript or negative
      regulation of translation. Little is known about the regulation or pattern of
      miRNA expression. The predicted presence of numerous miRNA sequences in higher
      eukaryotes makes it highly likely that the expression levels of individual miRNA 
      molecules themselves should play an important role in regulating multiple
      cellular processes. Therefore, determining the pattern of global miRNA expression
      levels in mammals and other higher eukaryotes is essential to help understand
      both the mechanism of miRNA transcriptional regulation as well as to help
      identify miRNA regulated gene expression. Here, we describe a novel method to
      detect global processed miRNA expression levels in higher eukaryotes, including
      human, mouse and rats, by using a high-density oligonucleotide array. Array
      results have been validated by subsequent confirmation of mir expression using
      northern-blot analysis. Major differences in mir expression have been detected in
      samples from diverse sources, suggesting highly regulated mir expression, and
      specific gene regulatory functions for individual miRNA transcripts. For example,
      five different miRNAs were found to be preferentially expressed in human kidney
      compared with other human tissues. Comparative analysis of surrounding genomic
      sequences of the kidney-specific miRNA clusters revealed the occurrence of
      specific transcription factor binding sites located in conserved phylogenetic
      foot prints, suggesting that these may be involved in regulating mir expression
      in kidney.

TI  - RNA interference: the molecular immune system.
PG  - 545-53
AB  - Introduction of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into cells expressing a homologous
      gene triggers RNA interference (RNAi), or RNA-based gene silencing (RBGS). The
      dsRNA degrades corresponding host mRNA into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by a 
      protein complex containing Dicer. siRNAs in turn are incorporated into the
      RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) that includes helicase, RecA, and exo- and
      endo-nucleases as well as other proteins. Following its assembly, the RISC guides
      the RNA degradation machinery to the target RNAs and cleaves the cognate target
      RNA in a sequence-specific, siRNA-dependent manner. RNAi has now been documented 
      in a wide variety of organisms, including plants, fungi, flies, worms, and more
      recently, higher mammals. In eukaryotes, dsRNA directed against a range of
      viruses (i.e., HIV-1, RSV, HPV, poliovirus and others) and endogenous genes can
      induce sequence-specific inhibition of gene expression. In invertebrates, RNAi
      can be efficiently triggered by either long dsRNAs or 21- to 23-nt-long siRNAs.
      However, in jawed vertebrates, dsRNA longer than 30 bp can induce interferon and 
      thus trigger undesirable side effects instead of initiating RNAi. siRNAs have
      been shown to act as potent inducers of RNAi in cultured mammalian cells. Many
      investigators have suggested that siRNAs may have evolved as a normal defense
      against endogenous and exogenous transposons and retroelements. Through a
      combination of genetic and biochemical approaches, some of the mechanisms
      underlying RNAi have been described. Recent data in C. elegans shows that two
      homologs of siRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) and tiny noncoding RNAs (tncRNAs) are
      endogenously expressed. However, many aspects of RNAi-induced gene silencing,
      including its origins and the selective pressures which maintain it, remain
      undefined. Its evolutionary history may pass through the more primitive immune
      functions of prokaryotes involving restriction enzymes that degrade plasmid DNA
      molecules that enter bacterial cells. RNAi has evolved further among eukaryotes, 
      in which its wide distribution suggests early origins. RNAi seems to be involved 
      in a variety of regulatory and immune functions that may differ among various
      kingdoms and phyla. We present here proposed mechanisms by which RBGS protects
      the host against endogenous and exogenous transposons and retroelements. The
      potential for therapeutic application of RBGS technology in treating viral
      infections such as HIV is also discussed.

TI  - Architecture of a validated microRNA::target interaction.
PG  - 1619-23
AB  - MicroRNAs are small approximately 22 nucleotide regulators of numerous biological
      processes and bind target gene messenger RNAs to control gene expression. The C. 
      elegans microRNA let-7 and its target lin-41 were the first microRNA::target
      interaction to be validated in vivo. let-7 molecules form imperfect duplexes with
      two required let-7 complementary sites in the lin-41 3' UTR. Here, we show that
      base pairing at both the 5' and 3' ends of the let-7 binding site, as well as the
      presence of unpaired RNA residues in the predicted duplexes, are required for
      lin-41 downregulation. In this study, our model for microRNA::target interactions
      also demonstrates that the context of a microRNA binding can be critical for
      function, revealing an unforeseen complexity in microRNA::target interactions.

TI  - Evaluation of sensitivity to 5-FU on the basis of thymidylate synthase
      (TS)/dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) activity and chromosomal analysis in
      micro tissue specimens of breast cancer.
PG  - 356-66
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preoperative assessment of the anticancer drug sensitivity of tumors 
      plays an important role in the selection of therapy. If evaluation of the 5-FU
      sensitivity of microtissue specimens obtained by techniques such as core needle
      biopsy could be performed, the addition of fluorouracil to adriamycin and
      cyclophosphamide may further enhance response rates. In order to evaluate a
      simple sensitivity test for the anti-tumor agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), we
      examined whether an assay of a small sample could measure mRNA to predict the
      activities of thymidylate synthase (TS) and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase
      (DPD). In addition, gene abnormalities on chromosomes 1 and 18 corresponding to
      DPD, TS and the relationships between the gene abnormalities and the amount of
      mRNA and activity were examined. METHOD: TS and DPD activity were measured using 
      the fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate ligand binding assay and radio enzymatic
      assay, respectively, while mRNA levels were assayed by real-time polymerase chain
      reaction. Chromosome 1 and 18 aberrations were investigated by fluorescence in
      situ hybridization (FISH) with centromere probes. RESULTS: TS mRNA and TS
      activity showed a positive correlation (r=0.518, p=0.0017). TS activity and TS
      mRNA were significantly higher in the nuclear grade 3 group than in the other
      groups (p=0.04, p=0.0072, respectively). TS activity and mRNA in tumor tissue
      tended to decrease in the progesterone receptor positive groups (p=0.059,
      p=0.066, respectively). There was no correlation between DPD mRNA and DPD
      activity in tumor tissue (r=0.139, p=0.4423). DPD mRNA was measured as
      282.88+/-170.68 copies/cell in tumor tissue and 635.88+/-310.04 copies/cell in
      normal tissue, and was thus significantly higher in normal tissue (p<0.001).
      CONCLUSIONS: TS mRNA showed a positive correlation with TS activity, suggesting
      that this method of using small amounts of tissue can replace anti-cancer drug
      sensitivity tests.

TI  - HIV-1 nef suppression by virally encoded microRNA.
PG  - 44
AB  - BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 21 to approximately 25-nucleotides (nt) long
      and interact with mRNAs to trigger either translational repression or RNA
      cleavage through RNA interference (RNAi), depending on the degree of
      complementarity with the target mRNAs. Our recent study has shown that HIV-1 nef 
      dsRNA from AIDS patients who are long-term non-progressors (LTNPs) inhibited the 
      transcription of HIV-1. RESULTS: Here, we show the possibility that nef-derived
      miRNAs are produced in HIV-1 persistently infected cells. Furthermore, nef short 
      hairpin RNA (shRNA) that corresponded to a predicted nef miRNA (approximately 25 
      nt, miR-N367) can block HIV-1 Nef expression in vitro and the suppression by
      shRNA/miR-N367 would be related with low viremia in an LTNP (15-2-2). In the
      15-2-2 model mice, the weight loss, which may be rendered by nef was also
      inhibited by shRNA/miR-N367 corresponding to suppression of nef expression in
      vivo. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that nef/U3 miRNAs produced in
      HIV-1-infected cells may suppress both Nef function and HIV-1 virulence through
      the RNAi pathway.

TI  - HIV-1 encoded candidate micro-RNAs and their cellular targets.
PG  - 43
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs of 21-25 nucleotides that specifically regulate
      cellular gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. miRNAs are derived
      from the maturation by cellular RNases III of imperfect stem loop structures of ~
      70 nucleotides. Evidence for hundreds of miRNAs and their corresponding targets
      has been reported in the literature for plants, insects, invertebrate animals,
      and mammals. While not all of these miRNA/target pairs have been functionally
      verified, some clearly serve roles in regulating normal development and
      physiology. Recently, it has been queried whether the genome of human viruses
      like their cellular counterpart also encode miRNA. To date, there has been only
      one report pertaining to this question. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been
      shown to encode five miRNAs. Here, we extend the analysis of miRNA-encoding
      potential to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Using computer-directed
      analyses, we found that HIV putatively encodes five candidate pre-miRNAs. We then
      matched deduced mature miRNA sequences from these 5 pre-miRNAs against a database
      of 3' untranslated sequences (UTR) from the human genome. These searches revealed
      a large number of cellular transcripts that could potentially be targeted by
      these viral miRNA (vmiRNA) sequences. We propose that HIV has evolved to use
      vmiRNAs as a means to regulate cellular milieu for its benefit.

      LNA-modified oligonucleotide probes.
PG  - e175
AB  - We describe here a new method for highly efficient detection of microRNAs by
      northern blot analysis using LNA (locked nucleic acid)-modified oligonucleotides.
      In order to exploit the improved hybridization properties of LNA with their
      target RNA molecules, we designed several LNA-modified oligonucleotide probes for
      detection of different microRNAs in animals and plants. By modifying DNA
      oligonucleotides with LNAs using a design, in which every third nucleotide
      position was substituted by LNA, we could use the probes in northern blot
      analysis employing standard end-labelling techniques and hybridization
      conditions. The sensitivity in detecting mature microRNAs by northern blots was
      increased by at least 10-fold compared to DNA probes, while simultaneously being 
      highly specific, as demonstrated by the use of different single and double
      mismatched LNA probes. Besides being highly efficient as northern probes, the
      same LNA-modified oligonucleotide probes would also be useful for miRNA in situ
      hybridization and miRNA expression profiling by LNA oligonucleotide microarrays.

TI  - Detection and quantification of circulating tumor cells in patients with
      esophageal cancer by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
PG  - 455-64
AB  - Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was used for detecting circulating 
      tumor cells. However, PCR was so sensitive that it detected a very low level of
      mRNA with no relevance to tumor cells. We analyzed the degree of micro-tumor
      spread in esophageal cancer patients using quantitative PCR. Samples were
      collected from 28 patients and 35 controls. Real-time quantitative PCR
      (LightCycler) was employed for the detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)
      and cytokeratin 20 (CK-20). In the CEA and CK-20 mRNA assays, 7 and 3 out of 28
      patients, respectively, showed higher mRNA levels in peripheral blood than the
      normal range based on values of controls (mean+/-2SD). Eleven out of 19, 4 out of
      14, and 2 out of 5 patients showed higher CEA mRNA levels in the samples from
      tumor drainage vein, costal bone marrow, and thoracic duct lymph, respectively.
      One of the 7 patients who showed higher CEA mRNA levels in pretreatment
      peripheral blood is currently free from disease. These findings reveal that
      quantitative PCR can discriminate high levels of cancer-specific expression from 
      low levels of illegitimate expression in blood. They also suggest that the
      identification of circulating tumor cells by the CEA mRNA assay is a reliable
      means of predicting early recurrence.

TI  - The human DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8 and Its D. melanogaster
      homolog are required for miRNA biogenesis.
PG  - 2162-7
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a family of small noncoding RNAs that are found in
      plants and animals (for recent reviews, see ). miRNAs are expressed in a
      developmentally and tissue-specific manner and regulate the translational
      efficiency and stability of partial or fully sequence-complementary mRNAs. miRNAs
      are excised in a stepwise process from double-stranded RNA precursors that are
      embedded in long RNA polymerase II primary transcripts (pri-miRNA). Drosha RNase 
      III catalyzes the first excision event, the release in the nucleus of a hairpin
      RNA (pre-miRNA), which is followed by export of the pre-miRNA to the cytoplasm
      and further processing by Dicer to mature miRNAs. Here, we characterize the human
      DGCR8, the DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8, and its Drosophila
      melanogaster homolog. We provide biochemical and cell-based readouts to
      demonstrate the requirement of DGCR8 for the maturation of miRNA primary
      transcripts. RNAi knockdown experiments of fly and human DGCR8 resulted in
      accumulation of pri-miRNAs and reduction of pre-miRNAs and mature miRNAs. Our
      results suggest that DGCR8 and Drosha interact in human cells and reside in a
      functional pri-miRNA processing complex.

TI  - Potential action of androstenedione on the proliferation and apoptosis of stromal
      endometrial cells.
PG  - 81
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperandrogenic conditions have been associated with a high
      prevalence of endometrial pathologies related to cell survival. However, the
      action of androgens on proliferation and apoptosis in endometrial cells is poorly
      understood. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of
      androstenedione on cell proliferation, cell death and expression of estrogen
      receptor (ER) isoforms and proteins related to apoptosis in endometrial cells
      using two in vitro experimental approaches. METHODS: The endometrial tissue was
      obtained from 20 eumenorrheic women [28.7 (25 - 35) years] during the early
      secretory phase. We analyzed cell proliferation (immunohistochemistry of Ki-67
      and spectrophotometric assay); apoptosis (DNA fragmentation (TUNEL) and Annexin
      V-FITC binding); ER-alpha, ER-beta bcl-2 and bax mRNA abundance (RT-PCR) in
      explants and isolated endometrial epithelial (EEC) and stromal cells (ESC)
      incubated with androstenedione 1 micro mol/l (A4) or A4 plus hydroxyflutamide 10 
      micro mol/l (F) for 24 h. RESULTS: In explants, A4 induced an increase of cell
      proliferation and a decrease on apoptosis in the stromal compartment (p < 0.05). 
      In isolated ESC, proliferation augmented with A4 (p < 0.05), whereas, no
      significant modifications in the expression of ER-alpha, ER-beta bcl-2 and bax
      nor in the apoptotic index were observed. In EEC, A4 increase the ER-beta mRNA
      abundance (p < 0.05) and a decrease of the bcl-2/bax ratio (p < 0.05), without an
      increase in the apoptotic index. Hydroxyflutamide reverted the effect of
      androstenedione on the parameters described. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate 
      that androstenedione may modulate cell survival, expression of ER-beta and
      proteins related to apoptosis, suggesting a potential mechanism that associates
      the effect of hyperandrogenemia on the endometrial tissue.

TI  - Substrate requirements for let-7 function in the developing zebrafish embryo.
PG  - 6284-91
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the regulation of gene expression at the
      post-transcriptional level by base pairing to the 3'-UTR (untranslated region) of
      mRNAs. The let-7 miRNA was first discovered in Caenorhabditis elegans and is
      evolutionarily conserved. We used zebrafish embryos as a vertebrate in vivo
      system to study substrate requirements for function of let-7. Injection of a
      double-stranded let-7 miRNA into the zygotes of zebrafish and frogs causes
      specific phenotypic defects. Only the antisense strand of the let-7 duplex has
      biological activity. In addition, co-injected mRNA of gfp fused to the 3'-UTR of 
      a zebrafish lin-41 ortholog (a presumed target of let-7) is silenced by let-7.
      Point mutant studies revealed that the two let-7 target sites in the lin-41
      3'-UTR are both essential and sufficient for silencing. let-7 and mir221
      together, but not either of them alone, can silence a construct with one of the
      let-7 target sites replaced by a target site for mir221, showing that two
      different miRNAs can provide the required cooperative effect. let-7 target sites 
      can be moved around: they are also functional when positioned in the coding
      sequence or even in the 5'-UTR of gfp. We took advantage of reporter and

TI  - New endophytic isolates of Muscodor albus, a volatile-antibiotic-producing
      fungus.
PG  - 4023-31
AB  - Muscodor albus, an endophytic fungus originally isolated from Cinnamomum
      zeylanicum, produces a mixture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in culture
      and its spectrum of antimicrobial activity is broad. Using the original isolate
      of M. albus as a selection tool, it has been possible to find other culturally
      and biochemically unique wild-type isolates of this organism existing as
      endophytes in a variety of other plant species, including Grevillea pterifolia
      (fern-leafed grevillea), Kennedia nigriscans (snake vine) and Terminalia
      prostrata (nanka bakarra) growing in the northern reaches of the Northern
      Territory of Australia. Interestingly, none of the new isolates had a culture
      morphology that was identical to the original isolate, nevertheless each
      possessed hyphal characteristics that resembled that isolate. Furthermore, their 
      ITS-5.8S rDNA sequences were 96-99 % identical to that of M. albus and the
      isolates were considered M. albus on the basis of the DNA sequence data. However,
      the VOCs produced by these new isolates greatly differed in quality from the
      original strain by virtue of the production of naphthalene, naphthalene,
      1,1'-oxybis-, and one or more other compounds. In bioassays with a range of test 
      micro-organisms, including fungi and bacteria, each isolate possessed biological 
      activity but the range of activity was great. Artificial mixtures of some of the 
      VOCs mimicked the effects of the VOCs of the fungus. The value of these
      observations to the biology and practical uses of M. albus in agriculture and
      other applications is discussed.

TI  - Development of a scaled up liver device incorporating cryo-preserved pig liver
      micro-organs.
PG  - 950-6
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Currently there is no effective therapy for most patients with
      fulminant or end stage liver disease. METHODS: Pig liver micro-organs (LMOs),
      which preserve liver micro-architecture and ensure a maximal 150-200mum distance 
      from a source of nutrients and gases have been prepared and a method to
      cryo-preserve them has been developed. A new scaled-up extra-corporeal liver
      device termed aLIVE-H in which LMOs are exposed to liver-like hemodynamic
      conditions has also been developed. The purpose of this work is to test the
      safety and function of cryo-preserved LMOs and how the hemodynamic properties of 
      the scaled up aLIVE device affect their function. RESULTS: Pig LMOs in aLIVE-H,
      transcribe albumin and Factor V at similar levels, irrespective of their position
      within the bioreactor, indicating that the hemodynamic features of the aLIVE-H
      device allow for homogeneous plasma distribution and proper function at different
      locations. Cryo-preserved LMOs transcribe albumin and Factor V at levels
      comparable to those transcribed by a normal pig liver. Connecting the aLIVE-H
      bioreactor to normal pigs did not affect key blood components and biochemical
      parameters. CONCLUSIONS: An extra-corporeal liver device aLIVE-H which imitates
      the hemodynamic and functional properties of the normal liver and incorporates
      cryo-preserved LMOs has been developed and characterized. aLIVE-H was found to
      perform key synthetic liver functions.

TI  - The etiological agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, appears to contain
      only a few small RNA molecules.
PG  - 8472-7
AB  - Small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) have recently been shown to be the main controllers
      of several regulatory pathways. The function of sRNAs depends in many cases on
      the RNA-binding protein Hfq, especially for sRNAs with an antisense function. In 
      this study, the genome of Borrelia burgdorferi was subjected to different
      searches for sRNAs, including direct homology and comparative genomics searches
      and ortholog- and annotation-based search strategies. Two new sRNAs were found,
      one of which showed complementarity to the rpoS region, which it possibly
      controls by an antisense mechanism. The role of the other sRNA is unknown,
      although observed complementarities against particular mRNA sequences suggest an 
      antisense mechanism. We suggest that the low level of sRNAs observed in B.
      burgdorferi is at least partly due to the presumed lack of both functional Hfq
      protein and RNase E activity.

TI  - MicroRNA expression detected by oligonucleotide microarrays: system establishment
      and expression profiling in human tissues.
PG  - 2486-94
AB  - MicroRNAs (MIRs) are a novel group of conserved short approximately 22
      nucleotide-long RNAs with important roles in regulating gene expression. We have 
      established a MIR-specific oligonucleotide microarray system that enables
      efficient analysis of the expression of the human MIRs identified so far. We show
      that the 60-mer oligonucleotide probes on the microarrays hybridize with labeled 
      cRNA of MIRs, but not with their precursor hairpin RNAs, derived from amplified, 
      size-fractionated, total RNA of human origin. Signal intensity is related to the 
      location of the MIR sequences within the 60-mer probes, with location at the 5'
      region giving the highest signals, and at the 3' end, giving the lowest signals. 
      Accordingly, 60-mer probes harboring one MIR copy at the 5' end gave signals of
      similar intensity to probes containing two or three MIR copies. Mismatch analysis
      shows that mutations within the MIR sequence significantly reduce or eliminate
      the signal, suggesting that the observed signals faithfully reflect the abundance
      of matching MIRs in the labeled cRNA. Expression profiling of 150 MIRs in five
      human tissues and in HeLa cells revealed a good overall concordance with
      previously published results, but also with some differences. We present novel
      data on MIR expression in thymus, testes, and placenta, and have identified MIRs 
      highly enriched in these tissues. Taken together, these results highlight the
      increased sensitivity of the DNA microarray over other methods for the detection 
      and study of MIRs, and the immense potential in applying such microarrays for the
      study of MIRs in health and disease.

TI  - The Drosha-DGCR8 complex in primary microRNA processing.
PG  - 3016-27
AB  - RNase III proteins play key roles in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis. The nuclear
      RNase III Drosha cleaves primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) to release hairpin-shaped
      pre-miRNAs that are subsequently cut by the cytoplasmic RNase III Dicer to
      generate mature miRNAs. While Dicer (class III) and other simple RNase III
      proteins (class I) have been studied intensively, the class II enzyme Drosha
      remains to be characterized. Here we dissected the action mechanism of human
      Drosha by generating mutants and by characterizing its new interacting partner,
      DGCR8. The basic action mechanism of Drosha was found to be similar to that of
      human Dicer; the RNase III domains A and B form an intramolecular dimer and
      cleave the 3' and 5' strands of the stem, respectively. Human Drosha fractionates
      at approximately 650 kDa, indicating that Drosha functions as a large complex. In
      this complex, Drosha interacts with DGCR8, which contains two double-stranded RNA
      (dsRNA)-binding domains. By RNAi and biochemical reconstitution, we show that
      DGCR8 may be an essential component of the pri-miRNA processing complex, along
      with Drosha. Based on these results, we propose a model for the action mechanism 
      of class II RNase III proteins.

TI  - Antitumor activity of small interfering RNA/cationic liposome complex in mouse
      models of cancer.
PG  - 7721-6
AB  - PURPOSE: The RNA interference effect is an alternative to antisense DNA as an
      experimental method of down-regulating a specific target protein. Although the
      RNA interference effect, which is mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) or
      micro-RNA, has potential application to human therapy, the hydrodynamic method
      usually used for rapid administration of oligonucleotides is unsuitable for use
      in humans. In this study, we have investigated the antitumor activity of a
      synthetic siRNA, B717, which is sequence specific for the human bcl-2 oncogene,
      complexed with a novel cationic liposome, LIC-101. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In a
      mouse model of liver metastasis, we administered B717/LIC-101 by bolus
      intravenous injection, adjusting the rate and volume of administration to what is
      feasible in human therapy. In a mouse model bearing prostate cancer in which the 
      cells were inoculated under the skin, B717/LIC-101 was administered
      subcutaneously around the tumor. RESULTS: The B717/LIC-101 complex inhibited the 
      expression of bcl-2 protein and the growth of tumor cell lines in vitro in a
      sequence-specific manner in the concentration range of 3 to 100 nmol/L.
      Furthermore, the complex had a strong antitumor activity when administered
      intravenously in the mouse model of liver metastasis. B717 (siRNA) was shown to
      be delivered to tumor cells in the mouse liver, but only when complexed with
      LIC-101. The complex also inhibited tumor cell growth in the mouse model bearing 
      prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: By combining siRNA with our cationic liposome, we
      overcame the difficulty of administering siRNA to animals in ways that can be
      applied in human therapy. Although our siRNA/liposome complex is not yet in
      clinical trials, it is expected to provide a novel siRNA therapy for cancer
      patients.

TI  - Mutation detection in the drug-resistant hepatitis B virus polymerase gene using 
      nanostructured reverse micelles.
PG  - 1609-11
AB  - The emergence of drug-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been reported in
      patients with prolonged administration of lamivudine, which is a potent drug for 
      the prevention of HBV infection. Lamivudine-resistant HBV has several types of
      mutations at the YMDD motif of its DNA polymerase. We successfully demonstrated
      that monitoring the hybridization behavior in nanostructured reverse micelles
      enables us to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). With the aid of
      reverse micelles, a model 40-mer oligonucleotide containing a single-base
      substitution was clearly distinguished from the normal, complementary
      oligonucleotide. In addition, we extended this technique to a high-throughput
      analysis. The results obtained with a 96-well micro-plate reader indicated the
      possibility of SNPs detection toward multiple samples of patients.

TI  - Microbead-based affinity chromatography chip using RNA aptamer modified with
      photocleavable linker.
PG  - 3730-9
AB  - A microbead-based affinity chromatography chip (micro-BACC) controlling hundreds 
      of nanoliters of reaction volume was developed to separate and analyze hepatitis 
      C virus (HCV) RNA polymerase protein by immobilization of an RNA aptamer on
      beads. A photocleavable linker was conjugated in between the beads and the
      aptamer to elute the bound RNA polymerase from the RNA aptamer in one step by UV 
      irradiation, resulting in an efficient method to elute and identify the target
      molecule bound on RNA using a mass spectrometer. This linker showed a cleavage
      activity over 70% upon UV irradiation at 1050 mW/cm2 for more than 5 min. The
      photoelution method could prevent the target molecule from contaminations in
      affinity chromatography caused by elution solutions of high salt concentration,
      extreme pH and detergent, respectively. In this chip, sample reagents up to 800
      nL could be metered quantitatively into the bead chamber using a nanoliter
      dispenser working, based on surface-guided flow control and pneumatic control by 
      external air pressure on the chip. RNA polymerase eluted after UV irradiation was
      successfully analyzed by trypsin treatment without additional purification. As a 
      result, using the aptamer, we could detect RNA polymerase from 800 nL hepatitis C
      patient serum containing 96 fmol HCV RNA polymerase. The detection limit of this 
      system was estimated to be 9.6 fmol HCV RNA polymerase.

TI  - Evolution of microRNA genes by inverted duplication of target gene sequences in
      Arabidopsis thaliana.
PG  - 1282-90
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) in plants and animals function as post-transcriptional
      regulators of target genes, many of which are involved in multicellular
      development. miRNAs guide effector complexes to target mRNAs through base-pair
      complementarity, facilitating site-specific cleavage or translational repression.
      Biogenesis of miRNAs involves nucleolytic processing of a precursor transcript
      with extensive foldback structure. Here, we provide evidence that genes encoding 
      miRNAs in plants originated by inverted duplication of target gene sequences.
      Several recently evolved genes encoding miRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana and other 
      small RNA-generating loci possess the hallmarks of inverted duplication events
      that formed the arms on each side of their respective foldback precursors. We
      propose a model for miRNA evolution that suggests a mechanism for de novo
      generation of new miRNA genes with unique target specificities.

TI  - Evaluation of three molecular biology-based assays for the detection of GB virus 
      C/hepatitis G virus in clinical specimens.
PG  - 314-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study was performed to evaluate the reliability of three
      reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, one commercial
      and two 'homebrew', for GB virus C (GBV-C)/hepatitis G virus (HGV) RNA detection 
      in clinical specimens. We, therefore, investigated the virus prevalence with the 
      method that gave us the best performances. METHODS: The commercial assay
      amplified sequences from the viral 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR) and
      non-structural 3 (NS3) region. The non-commercial assays 1 and 2 were based on
      different primers for the 5'UTR consensus sequence. RESULTS: The percentage of
      overall concordance by the three methods was 91.7%, raising to 93.0% when only
      the two non-commercial methods were compared. Assay 1 showed low sensitivity
      (57.1% vs. the commercial assay, 58.8% vs. assay 2), with 100% specificity. The
      commercial assay gave 18 of 54 (33.3%) 'false-negative' results, concordantly
      negative by the other assays. The prevalence of GBV-C/HGV RNA among the HIV+
      patients was 27.0 and 32.6% in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. CONCLUSION: These
      data suggest that assay 2 has higher reliability as compared to the other two
      methods and may be used for an accurate GBV-C/HGV RNA detection in clinical and
      epidemiological studies.

TI  - [Over expression of Reg IV in peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancer].
PG  - 1909-11
AB  - We previously performed a global analysis of the gene expression of gastric
      cancer cell lines established from peritoneal dissemination (SNU-5, SNU-16,
      SNU-719, KATO-III and GT3TKB) with the cDNA microarray method to identify the
      novel markers for the detection of micro-metastasis in peritoneal cavity. One of 
      the up-regulated genes is Reg IV, which is a member of the Reg gene family
      belonging to calcium dependent lectin (C-type lectin) gene superfamily. We have
      examined Reg IV potential as a novel marker for the detection of peritoneal
      micro-metastases of gastric cancer. Reg IV expression was examined in five
      gastric cancer cell lines established from peritoneal dissemination and compared 
      with myeloid leukemia cell (HL60), methothelial cell lines Met5A and the other
      gastric cell line established from primary tumor (SNU-1) by quantitative
      real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Reg IV was
      highly overexpressed in 4 gastric cancer cell lines established from peritoneal
      dissemination, but weakly expressed in other cell lines. According to Reg IV mRNA
      expression levels in surgically resected specimens, the quantity of Reg IV
      correlated with wall penetration. Furthermore, Reg IV mRNA expression level in
      the peritoneal wash from 35 gastric cancer patients was also prone to correlation
      with wall penetration. These results suggest that Reg IV may be involved in
      peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancers and Reg IV may be a potential novel
      marker for peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancers.

TI  - [Utility of dopa decarboxylase as a novel marker for the detection of peritoneal 
      micro-metastases of gastric cancer with realtime RT-PCR].
PG  - 1906-8
AB  - We have examined the utility of DDC as a novel marker for the detection of
      peritoneal micrometastases of gastric cancer. DDC mRNA in the peritoneal wash
      from 114 gastric cancer patients was quantified for a comparison of
      carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) mRNA by means of real-time RT-PCR with a
      fluorescently labeled probe to predict peritoneal recurrence. The cut-off value
      was set at the upper limit of the quantitative value for non-cancer patients, and
      those above this cut-off value constituted the micrometastasis (MM+) group.
      Thirteen of 15 cases with peritoneal dissemination were MM+DDC (87% sensitivity),
      and one of 48 t1 cases was MM+ (98% specificity). DDC levels in peritoneal washes
      from patients with synchronous peritoneal metastases were more than 50 times
      higher than in those from patients without metastasis (p<0.01). For 15 cases of
      peritoneal dissemination (seven cases were cytologically positive), DDC was
      positive in 13 cases (87% sensitivity), but CEA failed to detect micrometastases 
      in four cases (73% sensitivity), indicating that DDC is in some cases superior to
      CEA for the detection of peritoneal micrometastases of gastric cancer in terms of
      sensitivity as well as specificity, especially for poorly differentiated
      adenocarcinomas. Combination of CEA and DDC improved the accuracy of diagnosis up
      to 93%. These results suggest that DDC is potentially a novel marker for
      peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancer and that quantitative RT-PCR of DDC is
      reliable and efficient for the selection of patients for adjuvant intraperitoneal
      chemotherapy to prevent peritoneal recurrence.

AB  - Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon that results in differential
      expression of both alleles, depending on their parent of origin. We have recently
      identified many imprinted small non-coding RNA genes belonging to the C/D RNA and
      microRNA gene families, both of which are usually known to play key roles in
      post-transcriptional metabolism of specific genes (e.g. C/D RNAs guide ribose
      methylation of target RNAs while microRNAs elicit either translational repression
      or RNA interference). Although the functional and evolutionary significance of
      this association between C/D RNA genes, microRNA genes and genomic imprinting is 
      still highly elusive, these observations provide a framework for further analysis
      of the potential role of small non-coding RNAs in epigenetic control.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of sulphur-oxidizing Thiomonas sp. and its
      potential application in biological deodorization.
PG  - 495-503
AB  - AIMS: To isolate and characterize a sulphur-oxidizing bacterial strain from
      activated sludge and to evaluate its potential application in biological
      deodorization. METHODS AND RESULTS: A dominant sulphur-oxidizing bacterial
      strain, designated as strain SS, was isolated from an enrichment culture using
      thiosulphate as a sole energy source and CO2 as a sole carbon source. The cells
      of this organism were aerobic, rod-shaped, Gram-negative and motile. Strain SS
      could grow autotrophically, heterotrophically as well as mixotrophically.
      Autotrophic growth was observed at pH values ranging from 2.3 to 9.0.
      Phylogenetic analyses revealed that strain SS belonged to Group 1 of the genus
      Thiomonas, closely related to Thiomonas perometabolis and Thiomonas intermedia.
      The thiosulphate oxidation rates of strain SS at different pH values were
      evaluated in terms of oxygen uptake using a Micro-Oxymax respirometer. The
      results showed that the maximum oxidation rate of 5.65 mg l(-1) h(-1) occurred at
      56 h of growth and pH 6.0. Continuous H2S removal study demonstrated that strain 
      SS could remove more than 99% of H2S when the inlet concentration was below 58.6 
      ppm. Further increase of the inlet concentration to 118 ppm gave rise to a
      decline in the removal efficiency to ca 90%. CONCLUSIONS: The strong
      acidification of the culture medium during the later period could result in the
      deterioration of the growth activity and the metabolism activity of strain SS. In
      practical application, the problems caused by the end-product inhibition and the 
      acidification can be alleviated by periodical replacement of culture medium with 
      fresh medium. Given the physiological flexibility and the ability to remove H2S
      rapidly and efficiently, strain SS could be a good 'deodorizing' candidate.
      SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first time that Thiomonas
      species has been reported for biological deodorization application.

TI  - Sustained polymeric delivery of gene silencing antisense ODNs, siRNA, DNAzymes
      and ribozymes: in vitro and in vivo studies.
PG  - 393-404
AB  - Small interfering RNA (siRNA), antisense oligonucleotides (ODNs), ribozymes and
      DNAzymes have emerged as sequence-specific inhibitors of gene expression that may
      have therapeutic potential in the treatment of a wide range of diseases. Due to
      their rapid degradation in vivo, the efficacy of naked gene silencing nucleic
      acids is relatively short lived. The entrapment of these nucleic acids within
      biodegradable sustained-release delivery systems may improve their stability and 
      reduce the doses required for efficacy. In this study, we have evaluated the
      potential in vitro and in vivo use of biodegradable poly
      (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) copolymer (PLGA) microspheres as sustained delivery
      devices for ODNs, ribozyme, siRNA and DNA enzymes. In addition, we investigated
      the release of ODN conjugates bearing 5'-end lipophilic groups. The in vitro
      sustained release profiles of microsphere-entrapped nucleic acids were dependent 
      on variables such as the type of nucleic acid used, the nature of the lipophilic 
      group, and whether the nucleic acid used was single or double stranded. For in
      vivo studies, whole body autoradiography was used to monitor the bio-distribution
      of either free tritium-labelled ODN or that entrapped within PLGA microspheres
      following subcutaneous administration in Balb-c mice. The majority of the
      radioactivity associated with free ODN was eliminated within 24 h whereas
      polymer-released ODN persisted in organs and at the site of administration even
      after seven days post-administration. Polymer microsphere released ODN exhibited 
      a similar tissue and cellular tropism to the free ODN. Micro-autoradiography
      analyses of the liver and kidneys showed similar bio-distribution for
      polymer-released and free ODNs with the majority of radioactivity being
      concentrated in the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidney and in the Kupffer 
      cells of the liver. These findings suggest that biodegradable PLGA microspheres
      offer a method for improving the in vivo sustained delivery of gene silencing
      nucleic acids, and hence are worthy of further investigation as delivery systems 
      for these macromolecules.

TI  - Adenovirus VA1 noncoding RNA can inhibit small interfering RNA and MicroRNA
      biogenesis.
PG  - 12868-76
AB  - Although inhibition of RNA interference (RNAi) by plant virus proteins has been
      shown to enhance viral replication and pathogenesis in plants, no viral gene
      product has as yet been shown to inhibit RNAi in vertebrate cells. Here, we
      present evidence demonstrating that the highly structured approximately
      160-nucleotide adenoviral VA1 noncoding RNA can inhibit RNAi at physiological
      levels of expression. VA1, which is expressed at very high levels in
      adenovirus-infected cells, potently inhibited RNAi induced by short hairpin RNAs 
      (shRNAs) or human microRNA precursors but did not affect RNAi induced by
      artificial short interfering RNA duplexes. Inhibition appeared to be due both to 
      inhibition of nuclear export of shRNA or premicro-RNA precursors, competition for
      the Exportin 5 nuclear export factor, and inhibition of Dicer function by direct 
      binding of Dicer. Together, these data argue that adenovirus infection can result
      in inhibition of RNAi and identify VA1 RNA as the first viral gene product able
      to inhibit RNAi in human cells.

TI  - Gene expression profiling of human erythroid progenitors by micro-serial analysis
      of gene expression.
PG  - 239-45
AB  - We compared the expression profiles of highly purified human CD34+ cells and
      erythroid progenitor cells by micro-serial analysis of gene expression
      (microSAGE). Human CD34+ cells were purified from granulocyte colony-stimulating 
      factor-mobilized blood stem cells, and erythroid progenitors were obtained by
      cultivating these cells in the presence of stem cell factor, interleukin 3, and
      erythropoietin. Our 10,202 SAGE tags allowed us to identify 1354 different
      transcripts appearing more than once. Erythroid progenitor cells showed increased
      expression of LRBA, EEF1A1, HSPCA, PILRB, RANBP1, NACA, and SMURF. Overexpression
      of HSPCA was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. MicroSAGE
      revealed an unexpected preferential expression of several genes in erythroid
      progenitor cells in addition to the known functional genes, including
      hemoglobins. Our results provide reference data for future studies of gene
      expression in various hematopoietic disorders, including myelodysplastic syndrome
      and leukemia.

TI  - A pancreatic islet-specific microRNA regulates insulin secretion.
PG  - 226-30
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a growing class of non-coding RNAs that are thought
      to regulate gene expression by translational repression. Several miRNAs in
      animals exhibit tissue-specific or developmental-stage-specific expression,
      indicating that they could play important roles in many biological processes. To 
      study the role of miRNAs in pancreatic endocrine cells we cloned and identified a
      novel, evolutionarily conserved and islet-specific miRNA (miR-375). Here we show 
      that overexpression of miR-375 suppressed glucose-induced insulin secretion, and 
      conversely, inhibition of endogenous miR-375 function enhanced insulin secretion.
      The mechanism by which secretion is modified by miR-375 is independent of changes
      in glucose metabolism or intracellular Ca2+-signalling but correlated with a
      direct effect on insulin exocytosis. Myotrophin (Mtpn) was predicted to be and
      validated as a target of miR-375. Inhibition of Mtpn by small interfering (si)RNA
      mimicked the effects of miR-375 on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and
      exocytosis. Thus, miR-375 is a regulator of insulin secretion and may thereby
      constitute a novel pharmacological target for the treatment of diabetes.

TI  - FMRP and its target RNAs: fishing for the specificity.
PG  - 2447-50
AB  - Learning and memory difficulties observed in patients with fragile X syndrome, as
      well as in a mouse model for the syndrome, are partially due to impaired
      translational regulation of neuronal mRNAs encoding key molecules for the
      synaptic structure and function. There has been intense interest in
      characterizing the mRNAs that are regulated by the fragile X mental retardation
      protein (FMRP) in the neuronal cell. A large number of candidate FMRP-interacting
      mRNAs has been identified over the last few years and three models have been
      described so far to explain the specificity of these interactions. Here, we
      report our vision on how they could work in the same and/or in different pathways
      and suggest that the three mechanisms may not be mutually exclusive.

TI  - Highly efficient small interfering RNA delivery to primary mammalian neurons
      induces MicroRNA-like effects before mRNA degradation.
PG  - 10040-6
AB  - The study of protein function in neurons has been hindered by the lack of highly 
      efficient, nontoxic methods of inducing RNA interference in such cells. Here we
      show that application of synthetic small interfering RNA (siRNA) linked to the
      vector peptide Penetratin1 results in rapid, highly efficient uptake of siRNA by 
      entire populations of cultured primary mammalian hippocampal and sympathetic
      neurons. This treatment leads to specific knock-down of targeted proteins within 
      hours without the toxicity associated with transfection. In contrast to current
      methods, our technique permits study of protein function across entire
      populations with minimal disturbance of complex cellular networks. Using this
      technique, we found that protein knock-down (evident after 6 hr) precedes any
      decrease in targeted message (evident after 24 hr), suggesting an early,
      translational repression by perfectly targeted siRNAs.

TI  - The cell-type-specificity of inherited predispositions to tumours: review and
      hypothesis.
PG  - 127-46
AB  - Most hereditary predispositions to tumours affect only one particular cell type
      of the body but the genes bearing the relevant germ-line mutation are not
      cell-type-specific. Some predisposition syndromes include increased risks of
      lesions (developmental or tumourous) of unrelated cell types, in any individual
      predisposed to the main lesion (e.g. osteosarcoma in patients predisposed to
      retinoblastoma). Other predispositions to additional lesions occur only in
      members of some families with the predisposition to the basic lesion (e.g.
      Gardner's syndrome in some families suffering familial adenomatous polyposis). In
      yet other predisposition syndromes, different mutations of the same gene are
      associated with markedly differing family-specific clinical syndromes. In
      particular, identical germline mutations (e.g. in APC, RET and PTEN genes), have 
      been found associated with differing clinical syndromes in different families.
      This paper reviews previously suggested mechanisms of the cell-type specificity
      of inherited predispositions to tumour. Models of tumour formation in
      predisposition syndromes are discussed, especially those involving a germline
      mutation (the first 'hit') of a tumour suppressor gene (TSG) and a second
      (somatic) hit on the second allele of the same TSG. A modified model is
      suggested, such that the second hit is a co-mutation of the second allele of the 
      TSG and a regulator which is specific for growth and/or differentiation of the
      cell type which is susceptible to the tumour predisposition. In some cases of
      tumour, the second hit may be large enough to be associated with a
      cytogenetically-demonstrable abnormality of the part of the chromosome carrying
      the TSG, but in other cases, the co-mutation may be of 'sub-cytogenetic' size
      (i.e. 10(2)-10(5) bases). For the latter, mutational mechanisms of frameshift and
      impaired fidelity of replication of DNA by DNA polyerases may sometimes be
      involved. Candidate cell-type-specific regulators may include microRNAs and
      perhaps transcription factors. It is suggested that searching the introns within 
      10(5)-10(6) bases either side of known of exonic mutations of TSGs associated
      with inherited tumour predisposition might reveal microRNA cell-type-specific
      regulators. Additional investigations may involve fluorescent in situ
      hybridisations on interphase tumour nuclei.

TI  - Processing of primary microRNAs by the Microprocessor complex.
PG  - 231-5
AB  - Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) are generated via a two-step processing pathway to
      yield approximately 22-nucleotide small RNAs that regulate gene expression at the
      post-transcriptional level. Initial cleavage is catalysed by Drosha, a nuclease
      of the RNase III family, which acts on primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) in 
      the nucleus. Here we show that Drosha exists in a multiprotein complex, the
      Microprocessor, and begin the process of deconstructing that complex into its
      constituent components. Along with Drosha, the Microprocessor also contains Pasha
      (partner of Drosha), a double-stranded RNA binding protein. Suppression of Pasha 
      expression in Drosophila cells or Caenorhabditis elegans interferes with
      pri-miRNA processing, leading to an accumulation of pri-miRNAs and a reduction in
      mature miRNAs. Finally, depletion or mutation of pash-1 in C. elegans causes
      de-repression of a let-7 reporter and the appearance of phenotypic defects
      overlapping those observed upon examination of worms with lesions in Dicer
      (dcr-1) or Drosha (drsh-1). Considered together, these results indicate a role
      for Pasha in miRNA maturation and miRNA-mediated gene regulation.

TI  - The Microprocessor complex mediates the genesis of microRNAs.
PG  - 235-40
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a growing family of small non-protein-coding regulatory
      genes that regulate the expression of homologous target-gene transcripts. They
      have been implicated in the control of cell death and proliferation in flies,
      haematopoietic lineage differentiation in mammals, neuronal patterning in
      nematodes and leaf and flower development in plants. miRNAs are processed by the 
      RNA-mediated interference machinery. Drosha is an RNase III enzyme that was
      recently implicated in miRNA processing. Here we show that human Drosha is a
      component of two multi-protein complexes. The larger complex contains multiple
      classes of RNA-associated proteins including RNA helicases, proteins that bind
      double-stranded RNA, novel heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins and the
      Ewing's sarcoma family of proteins. The smaller complex is composed of Drosha and
      the double-stranded-RNA-binding protein, DGCR8, the product of a gene deleted in 
      DiGeorge syndrome. In vivo knock-down and in vitro reconstitution studies
      revealed that both components of this smaller complex, termed Microprocessor, are
      necessary and sufficient in mediating the genesis of miRNAs from the primary
      miRNA transcript.

TI  - A new Bacillus cereus DNA-binding protein, HlyIIR, negatively regulates
      expression of B. cereus haemolysin II.
PG  - 3691-701
AB  - Haemolysin II, HlyII, is one of several cytotoxic proteins produced by Bacillus
      cereus, an opportunistic human pathogen that causes food poisoning. The hlyII
      gene confers haemolytic activity to Escherichia coli cells. Here a new B. cereus 
      gene, hlyIIR, which is located immediately downstream of hlyII and regulates
      hlyII expression, is reported. The deduced amino acid sequence of HlyIIR is
      similar to prokaryotic DNA-binding transcriptional regulators of the TetR/AcrA
      family. Measurements of haemolytic activity levels and of hlyII promoter activity
      levels using gene fusions and primer-extension assays demonstrated that, in E.
      coli, hlyII transcription decreased in the presence of hlyIIR. Recombinant HlyIIR
      binds to a 22 bp inverted DNA repeat centred 48 bp upstream of the hlyII promoter
      transcription initiation point. In vitro transcription studies showed that HlyIIR
      inhibits transcription from the hlyII promoter by binding to the 22 bp repeat and
      RNA polymerase, and by decreasing the formation of the catalytically competent
      open promoter complex.

TI  - Uridine addition after microRNA-directed cleavage.
PG  - 997
AB  - One of the important roles of microRNA (miRNA) is to direct the cleavage of
      messenger RNA (mRNA). However, the mechanisms of decay of the cleaved mRNA
      products is not well understood. We show that miRNA-directed cleavage products in
      organisms as diverse as Arabidopsis, mouse, and Epstein-Barr virus have at their 
      3' ends a stretch (1 to 24 nucleotides) of oligouridine posttranscriptionally
      added downstream of the cleavage site. This 3' uridine addition, as shown for
      Arabidopsis, is correlated with decapping and 5' shortening of the cleaved
      products, suggesting a mechanistic step in the miRNA-directed mRNA decay
      mechanism.

AB  - New evidence suggests that abundant small RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) act as
      regulatory vehicles to repress translation or cleave RNA transcripts, depending
      on their complementarity to the target gene, and result in modulation of gene
      expression. This review describes that the miRNAs derived from introns can
      suppress intracellular RNA homologues and regulate the gene function.

TI  - Human microRNAs are processed from capped, polyadenylated transcripts that can
      also function as mRNAs.
PG  - 1957-66
AB  - The factors regulating the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), a ubiquitous family 
      of approximately 22-nt noncoding regulatory RNAs, remain undefined. However, it
      is known that miRNAs are first transcribed as a largely unstructured precursor,
      termed a primary miRNA (pri-miRNA), which is sequentially processed in the
      nucleus, to give the approximately 65-nt pre-miRNA hairpin intermediate, and then
      in the cytoplasm, to give the mature miRNA. Here we have sought to identify the
      RNA polymerase responsible for miRNA transcription and to define the structure of
      a full-length human miRNA. We show that the pri-miRNA precursors for nine human
      miRNAs are both capped and polyadenylated and report the sequence of the
      full-length, approximately 3433-nt pri-miR-21 RNA. This pri-miR-21 gene sequence 
      is flanked 5' by a promoter element able to transcribe heterologous mRNAs and 3' 
      by a consensus polyadenylation sequence. Nuclear processing of pri-miRNAs was
      found to be efficient, thus largely preventing the nuclear export of full-length 
      pri-miRNAs. Nevertheless, an intact miRNA stem-loop precursor located in the 3'
      UTR of a protein coding gene only moderately inhibited expression of the linked
      open reading frame, probably because the 3' truncated mRNA could still be
      exported and expressed. Together, these data show that human pri-miRNAs are not
      only structurally similar to mRNAs but can, in fact, function both as pri-miRNAs 
      and mRNAs.

      methylation of the template chromosome.
PG  - 653-62
AB  - Dominant mutations in the Arabidopsis PHABULOSA (PHB) and PHAVOLUTA (PHV)
      transcription factor genes cause transformation of abaxial to adaxial leaf fates 
      by altering a microRNA complementary site present in processed PHB and PHV mRNAs 
      but not in the corresponding genomic DNA. phb-1d mutants accumulate excess PHB
      transcript throughout the leaf primordium, indicating defective regulation of PHB
      transcript synthesis and/or stability. We show that PHB and PHV coding sequences 
      are heavily methylated downstream of the microRNA complementary site in most
      wild-type plant cells and that methylation is reduced in phb-1d and phv-1d
      mutants. Decreased methylation is limited to the chromosome bearing the dominant 
      mutant allele in phb-1d heterozygotes. Low levels of methylation are detected in 
      wt PHB DNA isolated from undifferentiated tissues. These results suggest a model 
      in which the microRNA interacts with nascent, newly processed PHB mRNA to alter
      chromatin of the corresponding PHB template DNA predominantly in differentiated
      cells.

TI  - MicroRNAs and the regulation of cell death.
PG  - 617-24
AB  - Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is ubiquitous, both during development and
      in the adult. Many components of the evolutionarily conserved machinery that
      brings about and regulates cell death have been identified, and all of these are 
      proteins. However, in the past three years it has become clear that roughly 1% of
      predicted genes in animals encode small noncoding RNAs known as microRNAs, which 
      regulate gene function. Here we review the recent identification of microRNA cell
      death regulators in Drosophila, hints that such regulators are also likely to
      exist in mammals, and more generally the approaches and tools that are now
      available to probe roles for noncoding RNAs in the control of cell death.

TI  - [CK20 mRNA expression in peripheral blood of patients with gastrointestinal
      carcinoma and its clinical significance].
PG  - 1350-3
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Detecting expression levels of cytokeratin 19 (CK19),
      CK20, MUC1, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in peripheral blood,lymph node,and
      bone marrow is a major method for diagnosing micro-metastasis in patients with
      gastrointestinal carcinoma of early stages. This study was to examine the
      expression, before and after operation, of CK20 mRNA in peripheral blood of
      patients with gastrointestinal carcinoma, to further explore hematogenous-spread 
      micro-metastasis status of these patients, and significance of CK20 mRNA
      detection in treatment during perioperation period. METHODS: Peripheral blood
      samples were collected before, and 2 weeks after operation from 62 patients with 
      gastrointestinal carcinoma,and 22 controls (12 patients with benign
      gastrointestinal disease, and 10 healthy volunteers). CK20 mRNA expression in the
      blood samples was specifically detected by nested reverse
      transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Pathologic examination of all
      cases was done by conventional methods. RESULTS: Of 62 patients with
      gastrointestinal carcinoma, 34 (54.3%) have positive CK20 mRNA expression before 
      operation,and so did 31 (50.0%) postoperatively, but no CK20 mRNA expressed in 22
      controls. In patients of stageI-IV, CK20 mRNA positive rates were 37.5% (3/8),
      36.3% (8/22), 66.7% (18/27), and 100% (5/5), respectively, difference between
      stage I+II (36.9%) and stage III+IV (83.3%) was significant (P< 0.05). Among 35
      patients with local lymph node metastasis, 27 (77.1%) were positive for CK20
      mRNA; among 27 patients without lymph node metastasis, 7 (25.9%) have positive
      CK20 mRNA expression (P< 0.01). CK20 mRNA expression was not correlated with
      tumor cell differentiation,and cancer embolus existance. There was no significant
      difference in CK20 mRNA expression before and after operation (P >0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: CK20 mRNA may be a sensitive marker for detecting
      micro-metastasis,and recurrence of patients with gastrointestinal carcinoma. It
      may be helpful for the correct clinical staging,and reasonable treatment for
      patients.

TI  - Nuclear export of RNA.
PG  - 639-55
AB  - A defining feature of eukaryotic cells is the presence of a nuclear envelope
      separating transcription and DNA replication in the nucleus from the site of
      protein synthesis in the cytoplasm. The regulation of gene expression relies in
      part on the controlled exchange of molecules between these two compartments.
      Factors implicated in transcription regulation and DNA replication have to be
      imported into the nucleus, whereas RNAs produced in the nucleus have to be
      exported, either to fulfill their function in protein synthesis or to mature into
      functional particles. This review summarizes studies performed over the last 15
      years that led to the identification of cellular factors mediating nuclear export
      of the different classes of RNAs, including tRNAs, UsnRNAs, micro-RNAs, ribosomal
      RNAs and mRNAs. We also discuss recent evidence indicating that the nuclear
      transport step is intimately linked to RNA synthesis, processing and mRNP
      assembly, thus ensuring that only properly matured ribonucleoprotein (RNP)
      complexes reach the cytoplasm.

      and animals. With few exceptions, however, the target genes and the expression
      levels of most miRNAs are unknown. Here we show that direct random-primed cDNA
      synthesis on either chemically synthesized small RNAs (21-22 nucleotides) or
      gel-purified mature miRNAs from human cells can produce specific and sensitive
      full-length cDNA probes. Using oligonucleotide filter arrays, we demonstrate that
      the internally labeled cDNA probes are sensitive for detecting differential miRNA
      expression between untreated and O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-treated 
      HL60 cells. The present study should facilitate a high-throughput analysis of
      miRNA expression between samples.

TI  - RNA and microRNAs in fragile X mental retardation.
PG  - 1048-53
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is caused by the loss of an RNA-binding protein called FMRP
      (for fragile X mental retardation protein). FMRP seems to influence synaptic
      plasticity through its role in mRNA transport and translational regulation.
      Recent advances include the identification of mRNA ligands, FMRP-mediated mRNA
      transport and the neuronal consequence of FMRP deficiency. FMRP was also recently
      linked to the microRNA pathway. These advances provide mechanistic insight into
      this disorder, and into learning and memory in general.

TI  - The herpes simplex virus type 1 latency-associated transcript (LAT) enhancer/rcr 
      is hyperacetylated during latency independently of LAT transcription.
PG  - 12508-18
AB  - During herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) latency, only one region of the viral 
      genome is actively transcribed: the region encoding the latency-associated
      transcript (LAT). A previous study demonstrated that during latency the LAT
      promoter is hyperacetylated at histone H3 (K9, K14) relative to lytic genes
      examined. In the present study, we examine the acetylation profile of regions
      downstream of the LAT promoter during a latent infection of murine dorsal root
      ganglia. These analyses revealed the following: (i) the region of the genome
      containing the 5' exon of the LAT primary transcript was at least as enriched in 
      acetylated H3 as the LAT promoter, and (ii) the region of hyperacetylation does
      not extend to the ICP0 promoter. In order to assess the contribution of LAT
      transcription to the acetylation of the 5' exon region, the acetylation profile
      of KOS/29, a recombinant with a deletion of the LAT promoter, was examined. The
      region containing the 5' exon of KOS/29 was hyperacetylated relative to lytic
      gene regions in the absence of detectable LAT transcription. These results
      indicate that the region containing the 5' exon of LAT, known to contain enhancer
      activities and to be critical for induced reactivation (rcr), exists in a
      chromatin structure during latency that is distinct from other lytic gene
      regions. This result suggests a role for the 5' exon LAT enhancer region as a
      cis-acting regulator of transcription that maintains a transcriptionally
      permissive chromatin domain in the HSV-1 latent episome.

TI  - Construction of a herpes simplex virus type 1 mutant with only a three-nucleotide
      change in the branchpoint region of the latency-associated transcript (LAT) and
      the stability of its two-kilobase LAT intron.
PG  - 12097-106
AB  - Previous studies using a eukaryotic expression system indicated that the unusual 
      stability of the latency-associated transcript (LAT) intron was due to its
      nonconsensus branchpoint sequence (T.-T Wu, Y.-H. Su, T. M. Block, and J. M.
      Taylor, Virology, 243:140-149, 1998). The present study investigated the role of 
      the branchpoint sequence in the stability of the intron expressed from the herpes
      simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) genome and the role of LAT intron stability in the
      HSV-1 life cycle. A branchpoint mutant called Sy2 and the corresponding rescued
      viruses, SyRA and SyRB, were constructed. To preserve the coding sequence of the 
      immediate early gene icp0, which overlaps with the branchpoint region of the 2-kb
      LAT, a 3-nucleotide mutation into the branchpoint region of the 2-kb LAT was
      introduced, resulting in a branchpoint that is 85% identical to the consensus
      intron branchpoint sequence of eukaryotic cells. As anticipated, there was a 90- 
      to 96-fold reduction in 2-kb LAT accumulation following productive infection in
      tissue culture and latent infection in mice with Sy2, as determined by Northern
      blot analysis. These results clearly suggest that the accumulation of the 2-kb
      intron in tissue culture and in vivo is, at least in part, due to the
      nonconsensus branchpoint sequence of the LAT intron. Interestingly, a failure to 
      accumulate LAT was associated with greater progeny production of Sy2 at a low
      multiplicity of infection (0.01) in tissue culture, but not in mice. However, the
      ability of mutant Sy2 to reactivate from trigeminal ganglia (TG) derived from
      latently infected mice was indistinguishable from that of wild-type virus, as
      assayed in the mouse TG explant reactivation system.

TI  - MicroRNA-143 regulates adipocyte differentiation.
PG  - 52361-5
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously expressed 20-24 nucleotide RNAs thought to
      repress protein translation through binding to a target mRNA (1-3). Only a few of
      the more than 250 predicted human miRNAs have been assigned any biological
      function. In an effort to uncover miRNAs important during adipocyte
      differentiation, antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting 86 human miRNAs were
      transfected into cultured human pre-adipocytes, and their ability to modulate
      adipocyte differentiation was evaluated. Expression of 254 miRNAs in
      differentiating adipocytes was also examined on a miRNA microarray. Here we
      report that the combination of expression data and functional assay results
      identified a role for miR-143 in adipocyte differentiation. miR-143 levels
      increased in differentiating adipocytes, and inhibition of miR-143 effectively
      inhibited adipocyte differentiation. In addition, protein levels of the proposed 
      miR-143 target ERK5 (4) were higher in ASO-treated adipocytes. These results
      demonstrate that miR-143 is involved in adipocyte differentiation and may act
      through target gene ERK5.

TI  - Human MicroRNA targets.
PG  - e363
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) interact with target mRNAs at specific sites to induce
      cleavage of the message or inhibit translation. The specific function of most
      mammalian miRNAs is unknown. We have predicted target sites on the 3'
      untranslated regions of human gene transcripts for all currently known 218
      mammalian miRNAs to facilitate focused experiments. We report about 2,000 human
      genes with miRNA target sites conserved in mammals and about 250 human genes
      conserved as targets between mammals and fish. The prediction algorithm optimizes
      sequence complementarity using position-specific rules and relies on strict
      requirements of interspecies conservation. Experimental support for the validity 
      of the method comes from known targets and from strong enrichment of predicted
      targets in mRNAs associated with the fragile X mental retardation protein in
      mammals. This is consistent with the hypothesis that miRNAs act as
      sequence-specific adaptors in the interaction of ribonuclear particles with
      translationally regulated messages. Overrepresented groups of targets include
      mRNAs coding for transcription factors, components of the miRNA machinery, and
      other proteins involved in translational regulation, as well as components of the
      ubiquitin machinery, representing novel feedback loops in gene regulation.
      Detailed information about target genes, target processes, and open-source
      software for target prediction (miRanda) is available at http://www.microrna.org.
      Our analysis suggests that miRNA genes, which are about 1% of all human genes,
      regulate protein production for 10% or more of all human genes.

      embryonic stem cells.
PG  - 269-86
AB  - The past few years have seen remarkable progress in our understanding of
      embryonic stem cell (ES cell) biology. The necessity of examining human ES cells 
      in culture, coupled with the wealth of genomic data and the multiplicity of cell 
      lines available, has enabled researchers to identify critical conserved pathways 
      regulating self-renewal and identify markers that tightly correlate with the ES
      cell state. Comparison across species has suggested additional pathways likely to
      be important in long-term self-renewal of ES cells including heterochronic genes,
      microRNAs, genes involved in telomeric regulation, and polycomb repressors. In
      this review, we have discussed information on molecules known to be important in 
      ES cell self-renewal or blastocyst development and highlighted known differences 
      between mouse and human ES cells. We suggest that several additional pathways
      required for self-renewal remain to be discovered and these likely include genes 
      involved in antisense regulation, microRNAs, as well as additional global
      repressive pathways and novel genes. We suggest that cross species comparisons
      using large-scale genomic analysis tools are likely to reveal conserved and
      divergent paths required for ES cell self-renewal and will allow us to derive ES 
      lines from species and strains where this has been difficult.

AB  - In this article, we describe the application of a novel micro elution solid-phase
      extraction method for purification of short stretches of DNA products of single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) prior to MALDI mass spectrometry analysis. An
      important feature of our method is that the purification columns containing a
      copolymer of divinylbenzene and N-vinylpyrrolidone can be used several times
      thereby significantly reducing costs. We implemented this DNA purification
      technology into a fully automated procedure including molecular biology, MALDI
      sample preparation, automated mass spectrometric analysis and SNP allele calling 
      by software. Due to the facile purification protocol, the methodology shown could
      furthermore be used for other applications where efficient medium to
      high-throughput purification of nucleic acids is required.

TI  - Tumour endothelial marker 8 (TEM-8) in human colon cancer and its association
      with tumour progression.
PG  - 948-53
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Tumour endothelial marker-8 (TEM-8) is endothelial cell
      surface marker that may be specific to tumour endothelial cells. This study
      examined the role of TEM-8 in human colon cancer and its correlation with tumour 
      prognosis. METHODOLOGY: Specimens of colorectal tissue (normal and cancer) were
      stained immunohistochemically with an anti-TEM-8 antibody, newly developed in our
      laboratory, and with anti-vonWillebrand Factor antibody. RNA was extracted from
      frozen sections for gene amplification. The anti-TEM-8 antibody specificity
      tested by using slot blotting with irrelevant antibody, and western blotting with
      different cell lines. The expression of TEM-8 was assessed using RT-PCR, and the 
      level of TEM-8 was quantified using real-time-quantitative PCR (Q-RT-PCR).
      RESULTS: TEM-8 staining was primarily seen in endothelial cells. TEM-8 identified
      more micro-vessels in colon tumour tissue, than in normal colon tissues,
      (p=0.002). Whereas, fewer vessels were stained positive for TEM-8 in normal
      tissues stained positive for vonWillebrand Factor (factor-8), (p=0.008).
      Malignant cells in tumour tissues were found to be stained strongly positive for 
      TEM-8 compared with the epithelial cells in normal colon tissues. The level of
      TEM-8 expression was significantly higher in the tumour tissues compared to the
      normal colon mucosa (p=0.001). TEM-8 mRNA expression was also found to be more
      elevated in patients with advanced tumour, Dukes C (Dukes A vs. Dukes C, p=0.01).
      CONCLUSION: TEM-8 is a marker that identifies tumour associated micro-vessels in 
      colon cancer. The levels of expression of TEM-8 in invasive colon cancer are
      linked to disease progression. This suggests that TEM-8 has significant
      prognostic and therapeutic values in colon cancer.

TI  - Transcriptomic responses to cadmium in the ectomycorrhizal fungus Paxillus
      involutus.
PG  - 423-7
AB  - The molecular mechanisms underlying the response of ectomycorrhizal fungi to
      heavy metals in general and cadmium in particular remain poorly understood. We
      screened 2040 arrayed cDNAs of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Paxillus involutus to
      identify cadmium-responsive genes by using differential hybridization. Forty nine
      (2.4%) of the 2040 cDNAs were differentially expressed, among which transcripts
      coding a laccase, an aconitase, and a metallothionein were upregulated by 3.9-,
      3.7- and 2.8-fold, respectively, whereas genes coding hydrophobins and threonine 
      dehydratase were strongly downregulated. Our results suggest that complexation of
      cadmium by phenolic compounds, or by complexing peptides such as
      metallothioneins, is probably key determinant of the cellular response to cadmium
      in P. involutus. In addition, the present study suggests that the synthesis of
      hydrophobins may be efficiently reduced, thus redirecting Cys to the manufacture 
      of Cys-enriched compounds.

TI  - Rapid, transient, and dose-dependent expression of hsp70 messenger RNA in the rat
      brain after morphine treatment.
PG  - 182-97
AB  - Induction of Hsp70 in the brain has been reported after intake of drugs of abuse 
      like amphetamine and lysergic acid diethylamide. In this investigation, gene
      expression of Hsp70 and other heat shock genes in the rat brain was studied in
      response to morphine. Twenty milligrams per kilogram morphine intraperitoneally
      resulted in a marked induction of Hsp70 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in the
      frontal cortex with a maximum increase of 13.2-fold after 2 hours. A moderate
      increase of Hsp27 mRNA expression (6.7-fold) could be observed after 4 hours,
      whereas mRNA expression of Hsp90 and of the constitutive Hsc70 did not exceed a
      mean factor of 1.8-fold during the 24 hours interval. The increase in Hsp70 mRNA 
      was dose dependent, showing a significant elevation after doses ranging from 10
      to 50 mg/kg morphine. In situ hybridization revealed enhanced Hsp70 mRNA
      expression mainly in cortical areas, in the hippocampus, in the paraventricular
      and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus, in the locus coeruleus, as well in the
      pineal body. The double in situ hybridization technique revealed increased Hsp70 
      mRNA expression mainly in VGLUT1-positive neurons and to a lesser extent in
      olig1-positive oligodendroglia. Immunohistochemistry revealed a marked increase
      of Hsp70 protein in neuronal cells and blood vessels after 12 hours. In contrast 
      to animal experiments, morphine did not increase Hsp70 mRNA expression in vitro
      in micro-opioid receptor (MOR1)-expressing human embryonic kidney 293 cells,
      suggesting no direct MOR1-mediated cellular effect. To exclude a body
      temperature-related morphine effect on Hsp70 mRNA expression, the temperature was
      recorded. Five to 20 mg/kg resulted in hyperthermia (maximum 40.6 degrees),
      whereas a high dose (50 mg/kg) that produced the highest mRNA induction, showed a
      clear hypothermia (minimum 37.2 degrees C). These findings argue against the
      possibility that Hsp70 induction by morphine is caused by its effect on body
      temperature. It may be speculated that increased expression of Hsp70 after
      morphine application protects brain structures against potentially hazardous
      effects of opiates.

TI  - RNA interference silencing the transcriptional message: aspects and applications.
PG  - 1-12
AB  - RNA interference (RNAi) is silencing of gene expression by double-stranded RNA
      (dsRNA) having complementary sequence to the target gene to be silenced. This
      phenomenon has transformed into a complete technology for functional genomic
      studies. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are 21- to 23-nucleotide dsRNAs, in
      which the sense strand is the same as the target mRNA and the antisense strand is
      the complement of the target mRNA sequence. These are the effector molecules for 
      inducing RNAi, leading to posttranscriptional gene silencing with RNA-induced
      silencing complex. Besides siRNA, which can be chemically synthesized, various
      other systems in the form of potential effector molecules for posttranscriptional
      gene silencing are available, such as short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), long dsRNAs,
      short temporal RNAs, and micro RNAs (miRNAs). These effector molecules either are
      processed into siRNA such as in the case of shRNA or directly aid gene silencing 
      as in the case of miRNA. RNAi for various unknown genes may facilitate to
      elucidate inherited genetic diseases and provide drug candidates for viral and
      oncogenic diseases. This can be achieved by targeting mRNA from oncogenic genes
      or mRNA for viral cellular receptor and viral structural proteins for RNAi. In
      this article, we evaluate various aspects and applications of RNAi technology and
      provide comprehensive information for the system currently available for inducing
      RNAi.

TI  - Probing microRNAs with microarrays: tissue specificity and functional inference.
PG  - 1813-9
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, stable, noncoding RNAs involved in
      post-transcriptional gene silencing via hybridization to mRNA. Few have been
      thoroughly characterized in any species. Here, we describe a method to detect
      miRNAs using micro-arrays, in which the miRNAs are directly hybridized to the
      array. We used this method to analyze miRNA expression across 17 mouse organs and
      tissues. More than half of the 78 miRNAs detected were expressed in specific
      adult tissues, suggesting that miRNAs have widespread regulatory roles in adults.
      By comparing miRNA levels to mRNA levels determined in a parallel microarray
      analysis of the same tissues, we found that the expression of target mRNAs
      predicted on the basis of sequence complementarity is unrelated to the tissues in
      which the corresponding miRNA is expressed.

TI  - Gene expression profile at the G1/S transition of liver regeneration after
      partial hepatectomy in mice.
PG  - 1405-17
AB  - Liver is a quiescent organ with >90% of the cells present in the G(0) stage of
      the cell cycle. However, adult hepatocytes have enormous ability to proliferate
      in response to liver injury. After 70% liver resection hepatocytes enter the cell
      cycle in a highly synchronized manner and undergo 1 to 2 rounds of cell division 
      to restore the lost organ mass, thus, representing one of the most reliable model
      systems to study cell cycle progression in vivo. Using high density
      oligonucleotide micro-array we analyzed the expression patterns of genes at the
      G(1)/S transition of liver regeneration in comparison to quiescent livers. The
      G(1)/S boundary was identified by in vivo BrdU pulse labeling and we observed 199
      genes/ESTs which were either up/down regulated at this time point. These
      differentially regulated genes have a wide range of functions including
      transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, chromatin
      reorganization, protein targeting, metabolism, transport, surface receptors,
      circadian rhythms, xenobiotic metabolism, inflammation and acute phase response. 
      The functions of most of the genes identified in this screen are not known in the
      process of liver regeneration and cell cycle control at G(1)/S transition.

PG  - 641-50
AB  - Non-cell-autonomous signals in the form of microRNAs and transcription factors
      could have important developmental functions. Plasmodesmata (PD) form a
      cytoplasmic network throughout the plant body and provide the means of symplasmic
      cell-to-cell transport in plants. Homeodomain transcription factors, small RNA
      molecules and viral genomic information move selectively to adjacent cells via PD
      microchannels. Tissue-specific expression studies of non-cell-autonomous
      transcription factors and RNA molecules have confirmed that their intercellular
      transport is a highly regulated process, which depends on the tissue,
      developmental stage and nature of the transported macromolecule. We have known
      for some time that gene-silencing signals spread both locally from cell to cell
      and across long distances following the source to sink transition. Recent work
      has provided evidence that small single-stranded silencing-induced RNAs and
      microRNA molecules are present in the phloem transport system of different plant 
      species. Further, recent evidence has confirmed that the transport of silencing
      RNA via PD is a regulated and active process, and that an amplification-relay
      mechanism is in place for the long-distance spread of silencing signals.

      in freshwater wetlands.
PG  - 445-50
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of Enterobacteriaceae
      (potential human and animal pathogens) in wetlands. METHODS: Enterobacteriaceae, 
      selected from the sediments and rhizosphere of wetland plant Juncus effusus L.,
      were analysed using classical microbiological methods, API20E, API20NE, fatty
      acid analyses, and 16S rRNA sequencing. Assessed virulence factors include
      antibiotic resistance, presence of plasmids and capsules. RESULTS: Klebsiella
      pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter asburiae, known human
      pathogens, were identified. K. pneumoniae 16S rRNA gene sequence showed the
      significant hit (E < 0.001) with the unculturable bacteria obtained from faeces
      of elderly individuals (accession number AB099804) when Genbank database was
      used. Ent. asburiae 16S rRNA gene sequence showed the significant hit with (E <
      0.001) with the unculturable bacteria obtained from the pig gastrointestinal
      tract (accession number AF371852). The rate of antibiotic resistance (<50 microg 
      ml(-1)) was high for ampicillin and cephalosporins for the most strains (75.7%)
      yet low (>10 to 20 microg ml(-1)) for kanamycin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol
      for all strains tested. Capsules were detected in all investigated strains. PCR
      detected membrane protein but not chromosomally encoded beta-lactamase.
      SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The antibiotic resistance of tested strains
      and presence of capsules (protect micro-organisms from phagocytosis) suggest that
      wetland sediments and rhizosphere present a potential reservoirs for enteric
      human and animal pathogens.

TI  - Energy gradients for VT-signal migration in the CNS: studies on melanocortin
      receptors, mitochondrial uncoupling proteins and food intake.
PG  - 23-34
AB  - The present paper enlightens a new point of view on brain homeostasis and
      communication, namely how the brain takes advantage of different
      chemical-physical phenomena such as pressure waves, and temperature and
      concentration gradients to allow the homeostasis of the brain internal milieu as 
      well as some forms of intercellular communications (volume transmission, VT) at
      an energy cost much lower than the classical synaptic transmission (the prototype
      of wiring transmission, WT). The possible melanocortin control of uncoupling
      protein 2 (UCP2) expression (hence of local brain temperature gradients) has been
      studied in relation to food intake in male Wistar rats. Osmotic minipumps were
      subcutaneously (sc) implanted in the midscapular region for
      intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion. The control rats received an icv infusion
      of 0.5 microl/h of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), while experimental rats
      received either an icv infusion of 0.16 nmol/h of HS024 or of 0.16 nmol/h of
      adrenocorticotropin-(1-24) [ACTH-(1-24)]. The ACTH-treated group ate
      significantly less than the ACSF-treated group during the first three days of
      infusion, while, subsequently, food intake of the two groups was similar. On the 
      other hand, the HS024-treated group ate significantly more (up to 153% of the
      control value) than ACSF- and ACTH-treated rats during the entire period. UCP2
      mRNA analysis in arcuate nuclei of ACTH, HS024 and ACSF-treated animals showed a 
      significant 75% decrease (p<0.05 vs saline) of the total specific mRNA level in
      the HS024-treated group vs ACSF-treated animals (control group), while no
      significant change was observed between ACTH- and ACSF-treated animals.
      Melanocortin antagonist HS024 via blockade of MCR4 increases food intake and via 
      a reduction of UCP2 expression enhances the food consumption ratio. This result
      underlines the fact that UCP2 expression and food intake can be differentially
      regulated. In other words, via a peptidergic control the central nervous system
      (CNS) can modulate the energy stored from the amount of the food that the animal 
      has eaten and also uncouple the thermal micro-gradients (dependent on UCP2
      expression) and hence the VT-signal micro-migrations from the food intake. It
      should also be noticed that the control of the thermal gradients affects also the
      neuronal firing rate and hence the transmitter release (likely above all the
      release of peptides such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), melanin-concentrating hormone
      (MCH) and beta-endorphin, e.g., in the arcuate nucleus representing signals
      relevant to energy homeostasis). Thus, WT and VT are both modulated by
      peptidergic signals that affect thermal gradients.

TI  - Reduction of bacterial indicators and bacteriophages infecting faecal bacteria in
      primary and secondary wastewater treatments.
PG  - 1069-76
AB  - AIMS: To compare the suitability of various bacterial and viral indicators to
      assess the removal of faecal micro-organisms by primary and secondary wastewater 
      treatment processes. METHODS AND RESULTS: The numbers of several bacterial
      indicators [faecal coliforms (FC), enterococci (ENT) and sulphite-reducing
      clostridia (SRC)] and bacteriophages (somatic coliphages, F-specific RNA phages
      and bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides fragilis strain RYC2056) were determined
      in incoming raw sewage and effluents from various primary and secondary
      wastewater treatment processes in several geographical areas. Reductions in the
      numbers of indicators were calculated as log10 reductions. Processes based on
      removal and mild disinfection, showed no significant differences in the
      elimination of any of the indicators tested or between geographical areas. In
      contrast, treatment processes that include strong microbial inactivation, such as
      lime-aided flocculation and lagooning, showed significant differences between the
      log10 reductions of the various micro-organisms studied, FC showing the highest
      reduction and spores of SRC and phages infecting B. fragilis the lowest.
      CONCLUSIONS: The microbial elimination performance of treatment processes based
      principally on removal and mild disinfection can be evaluated with a single
      indicator. In contrast, processes with additional disinfecting capabilities
      require more than one indicator for accurate evaluation of the treatment;
      bacteriophages are good candidates for use as second indicators. SIGNIFICANCE AND
      IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Bacteriophages provide additional information for the
      evaluation of microbial elimination in some treatment plants. The easy, fast and 
      cheap methods available for phage determination are feasible both in
      industrialized and developing countries.

TI  - Endogenous trans-acting siRNAs regulate the accumulation of Arabidopsis mRNAs.
PG  - 69-79
AB  - Here we describe a set of endogenous short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in
      Arabidopsis, some of which direct the cleavage of endogenous mRNAs. These siRNAs 
      correspond to both sense and antisense strands of a noncoding RNA (At2g27400)
      that apparently is converted to double-stranded RNA and then processed in 21 nt
      increments. These siRNAs differ from previously described regulatory small RNAs
      in two respects. First, they require components of the cosuppression pathway
      (RDR6 and SGS3) and also components of the microRNA (miRNA) pathway (AGO1, DCL1, 
      HEN1, and HYL1) but not components needed for heterochromatic siRNAs (DCL3 and
      RDR2), another class of endogenous plant siRNAs. Second, these siRNAs repress the
      expression of genes that have little overall resemblance to the genes from which 
      they originate, a characteristic previously reported only for miRNAs. The
      identification of this silencing pathway provides yet another dimension to
      posttranscriptional mRNA regulation in plants.

TI  - SGS3 and SGS2/SDE1/RDR6 are required for juvenile development and the production 
      of trans-acting siRNAs in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 2368-79
AB  - Higher plants undergo a transition from a juvenile to an adult phase of
      vegetative development prior to flowering. Screens for mutants that undergo this 
      transition precociously produced alleles of two genes required for
      posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS)--SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING3 (SGS3)
      and SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING2(SGS2)/SILENCING DEFECTIVE1 (SDE1)/RNA-DEPENDENT
      POLYMERASE6 (RDR6). Loss-of-function mutations in these genes have a phenotype
      similar to that of mutations in the Argonaute gene ZIPPY (ZIP). Epistasis
      analysis suggests that ZIP, SGS3, SGS2/SDE1/RDR6, and the putative miRNA export
      receptor, HASTY (HST), operate in the same pathway(s). Microarray analysis
      revealed a small number of genes whose mRNA is increased in ZIP, SGS3, and
      SGS2/SDE1/RDR6 mutants, as well as genes that are up-regulated in SGS3 and
      SGS2/SDE1/RDR6 mutants, but not in ZIP mutants. One of these latter genes
      (At5g18040) is silenced posttranscriptionally in trans by the sRNA255 family of
      endogenous, noncoding, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). The increase in At5g18040
      mRNA in SGS3 and SGS2/SDE1/RDR6 mutants is attributable to the absence of
      sRNA255-like siRNAs in these mutants. These results demonstrate a role for
      endogenous siRNAs in the regulation of gene expression, and suggest that PTGS
      plays a central role in the temporal control of shoot development in plants.

TI  - GadY, a small-RNA regulator of acid response genes in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 6698-705
AB  - A previous bioinformatics-based search for small RNAs in Escherichia coli
      identified a novel RNA named IS183. The gene encoding this small RNA is located
      between and on the opposite strand of genes encoding two transcriptional
      regulators of the acid response, gadX (yhiX) and gadW (yhiW). Given that IS183 is
      encoded in the gad gene cluster and because of its role in regulating acid
      response genes reported here, this RNA has been renamed GadY. We show that GadY
      exists in three forms, a long form consisting of 105 nucleotides and two
      processed forms, consisting of 90 and 59 nucleotides. The expression of this
      small RNA is highly induced during stationary phase in a manner that is dependent
      on the alternative sigma factor sigmaS. Overexpression of the three GadY RNA
      forms resulted in increased levels of the mRNA encoding the GadX transcriptional 
      activator, which in turn caused increased levels of the GadA and GadB glutamate
      decarboxylases. A promoter mutation which abolished gadY expression resulted in a
      reduction in the amount of gadX mRNA during stationary phase. The gadY gene was
      shown to overlap the 3' end of the gadX gene, and this overlap region was found
      to be necessary for the GadY-dependent accumulation of gadX mRNA. We suggest that
      during stationary phase, GadY forms base pairs with the 3'-untranslated region of
      the gadX mRNA and confers increased stability, allowing for gadX mRNA
      accumulation and the increased expression of downstream acid resistance genes.

TI  - MicC, a second small-RNA regulator of Omp protein expression in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 6689-97
AB  - In a previous bioinformatics-based search for novel small-RNA genes encoded by
      the Escherichia coli genome, we identified a region, IS063, located between the
      ompN and ydbK genes, that encodes an approximately 100-nucleotide small-RNA
      transcript. Here we show that the expression of this small RNA is increased at a 
      low temperature and in minimal medium. Twenty-two nucleotides at the 5' end of
      this transcript have the potential to form base pairs with the leader sequence of
      the mRNA encoding the outer membrane protein OmpC. The deletion of IS063
      increased the expression of an ompC-luc translational fusion 1.5- to 2-fold, and 
      a 10-fold overexpression of the small RNA led to a 2- to 3-fold repression of the
      fusion. Deletion and overexpression of the IS063 RNA also resulted in increases
      and decreases, respectively, in OmpC protein levels. Taken together, these
      results suggest that IS063 is a regulator of OmpC expression; thus, the small RNA
      has been renamed MicC. The antisense regulation was further demonstrated by the
      finding that micC mutations were suppressed by compensatory mutations in the ompC
      mRNA. MicC was also shown to inhibit ribosome binding to the ompC mRNA leader in 
      vitro and to require the Hfq RNA chaperone for its function. We suggest that the 
      MicF and MicC RNAs act in conjunction with the EnvZ-OmpR two-component system to 
      control the OmpF/OmpC protein ratio in response to a variety of environmental
      stimuli.

TI  - [MicroRNAs: a new class of gene expression regulators].
PG  - 894-8
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRs) are small non coding RNA, about 21-25 nucleotides in length,
      that direct post transcriptional regulation of gene expression through
      interaction with homologous mRNAs. Hundreds miR genes have been identified in
      animals and 40 in plants. Many of them are conserved between related species, and
      in some cases across phyla. Two mechanisms for regulation of gene expression by
      miRs have been reported. As described for lin-4 and let-7 miR of C.elegans, miRs 
      can inhibit translation, which seems to represent the major mode of regulation in
      animals, or can direct cleavage of target mRNAs, which seems to represent the
      major mode of regulation in plants.

TI  - Molecular mechanisms of translational control.
PG  - 827-35
AB  - Translational control is widely used to regulate gene expression. This mode of
      regulation is especially relevant in situations where transcription is silent or 
      when local control over protein accumulation is required. Although many examples 
      of translational regulation have been described, only a few are beginning to be
      mechanistically understood. Instead of providing a comprehensive account of the
      examples that are known at present, we discuss instructive cases that serve as
      paradigms for different modes of translational control.

TI  - Relationship between bacterial infection and evaluation using a laser
      fluorescence device, DIAGNOdent.
PG  - 419-23
AB  - The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the relationship between
      bacterial infections in carious dentin when detected by two different methods -- 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and a laser fluorescence device, DIAGNOdent.
      Dentin was removed every 300 micro m in the direction of the pulp chamber in 10
      extracted molars with occlusal dentin caries and 3 extracted sound molars. Dentin
      surfaces were evaluated using DIAGNOdent, and dentinal tissue samples were
      removed by using a round bur before and after each removal. Bacterial DNA in the 
      dentinal tissues was detected by PCR, using primers based on the nucleotide
      sequence of a conserved region of the 16S rDNA, and yielded a PCR product of 466 
      bp. The rates of bacterial detection increased as the DIAGNOdent values
      increased. In the 10 specimens, the lowest DIAGNOdent value at which bacteria
      were detected was 15.6; at DIAGNOdent values below 15.6, no bacteria were
      detected. The results of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the 
      DIAGNOdent values showed that the area under the ROC curve was 0.91. This study
      clarified the relationship between the DIAGNOdent values of dentin caries and the
      rates of bacterial detection.

TI  - [Inhibiting proliferation of cultured rat lens epithelial cells by bFGF antisense
      oligonucleotides and their liposomes].
PG  - 528-32
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)
      antisense oligonucleotides and their liposomes on the proliferation of cultured
      rat lens epithelial cells (LECs). METHODS: The rat LECs were cultured and bFGF
      antisense oligonucleotides (AONs), sense oligonucleotides (SONs), AON liposomes, 
      SON liposomes were added to second passage of cells supplied with DMEM while
      empty liposomes served as controls. MTT assay was used to examine the
      proliferation of LECs, and RT-PCR was performed to quantify bFGF mRNA expression 
      in LECs 24 h after treatment. RESULTS: The Shapes of rat LECs were polygonal
      after 24 h in culture. Cell confluence was reached in 2 - 3 weeks. After
      subculture, confluence was occurred in 1 - 2 weeks. The results of MTT assay were
      showed that the absorption (A) value of bFGF AONs was 0.138 +/- 0.074, and that
      of bFGF SONs and DMEM control were 0.325 +/- 0.097 and 0.370 +/- 0.079,
      respectively. The A value of AONs was significantly less than SONs and DMEM alone
      (P = 0.024, P = 0.005). The absorption (A) value of bFGF AON liposomes was 0.128 
      +/- 0.032, and that of bFGF SON liposomes and liposomes alone were 0.238 +/-
      0.120 and 0.348 +/- 0.017. The absorption (A) value of AON liposomes was not
      significantly different from that of liposomes negative control (P = 0.000). By
      RT-PCR, the amounts of PCR product for bFGF AONs, SONs and DMEM control were 0.33
      micro g, 0.99 micro g, 0.85 micro g. The amounts of PCR product of bFGF AON
      liposomes, SON liposomes and liposomes only were 0.23 micro g, 0.48 micro g, 0.56
      micro g. CONCLUSIONS: The proliferation of cultured rat LECs is inhibited by the 
      treatment of the antisense oligonucleotides, the inhibition is correlated with
      decreased expression of bFGF mRNA.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor and its
      receptor FLK1 in krypton laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in
      Brown Norway rat. METHODS: Thirty anesthetized male Brown Norway rats received
      krypton laser (647 nm, 360 mW, 50 micro m, 0.05 s) to induce CNV. Fundus
      fluorescein angiography examinations were performed just before euthanasia on
      days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 56 after laser photocoagulation. The retina was
      processed for histopathology analysis. VEGF mRNA, VEGF and FLK1 expressions were 
      demonstrated using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry staining
      respectively. RESULTS: VEGF mRNA expression was mainly observed in the vascular
      endothelial cells, the ganglion cells, the inner nuclear layers, the retinal
      pigment epithelial cells in normal retina and the vascular endothelial cells of
      normal choroid of BN rat. VEGF mRNA expressed in the vascular endothelial cells, 
      the ganglion cells, the inner nuclear layers, lesion of outer nuclear layers in
      retina on days 3 after photocoagulation, but CNV wasn't detected. The level of
      VEGF mRNA expression in retina was decreased after 3 days (P < 0.01). CNV was
      firstly observed on day 7 after photocoagulation by FFA and histopathology. The
      area and density of positively stained cells for VEGF mRNA in CNV were increased 
      during the development of CNV (P < 0.01) and no significant change after days 21 
      (P > 0.05). FLK1 was detected in the vascular endothelial cells, the ganglion
      cells of normal retina and the vascular endothelial cells of choroid. The
      staining of FLK1 was positive in laser induced CNV after days 7, the level of the
      receptor expression was increased during the development of CNV (P < 0.01) and
      was not significantly changed after days 21 (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: VEGF and its
      receptor FLK1 accumulation and combination in the lesion of retina and choroid
      are related to choroidal neovascularization induced by laser.

TI  - A population-based statistical approach identifies parameters characteristic of
      human microRNA-mRNA interactions.
PG  - 139
AB  - BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs are approximately 17-24 nt. noncoding RNAs found in all
      eukaryotes that degrade messenger RNAs via RNA interference (if they bind in a
      perfect or near-perfect complementarity to the target mRNA), or arrest
      translation (if the binding is imperfect). Several microRNA targets have been
      identified in lower organisms, but only one mammalian microRNA target has yet
      been validated experimentally. RESULTS: We carried out a population-wide
      statistical analysis of how human microRNAs interact complementarily with human
      mRNAs, looking for characteristics that differ significantly as compared with
      scrambled control sequences. These characteristics were used to identify a set of
      71 outlier mRNAs unlikely to have been hit by chance. Unlike the case in C.
      elegans and Drosophila, many human microRNAs exhibited long exact matches (10 or 
      more bases in a row), up to and including perfect target complementarity. Human
      microRNAs hit outlier mRNAs within the protein coding region about 2/3 of the
      time. And, the stretches of perfect complementarity within microRNA hits onto
      outlier mRNAs were not biased near the 5'-end of the microRNA. In several cases, 
      an individual microRNA hit multiple mRNAs that belonged to the same functional
      class. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis supports the notion that sequence
      complementarity is the basis by which microRNAs recognize their biological
      targets, but raises the possibility that human microRNA-mRNA target interactions 
      follow different rules than have been previously characterized in Drosophila and 
      C. elegans.

TI  - Augmented heme oxygenase-1 induces prostaglandin uptake via the prostaglandin
      transporter in micro-vascular endothelial cells.
PG  - 1299-305
AB  - Previous studies show that expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in endothelial
      cells results in decreased cyclooxygenase expression and prostaglandin (PG)
      levels through limiting heme availability. Regulation of PGs, important
      inflammatory mediators, may contribute to the anti-inflammatory potential of
      HO-1. Here we examine the effects of HO-1 expression on PG clearance via the
      prostaglandin transporter (PGT). Endothelial cells expressing human HO-1 via
      retroviral transfer exhibit approximately 7-fold higher levels of PGT RNA and
      equivalently elevated uptake of [(3)H]PGE(2). The pattern and extent of uptake
      and the substrate inhibitory constants of PGE(2), PGF(2alpha), and thromboxane
      B(2) are similar to those of cloned PGT. Treatment of cells with stannous
      chloride, an inducer of HO-1, results in increased expression of PGT while
      incubation of cells expressing human HO-1 with stannic mesophorphyrin, a
      substrate inhibitor of HO-1, decreases PG uptake. Therefore, PG clearance via PGT
      may contribute to the cellular regulation of PG levels by HO-1.

TI  - Protein synthesis, RNA concentrations, nitrogen excretion, and metabolism vary
      seasonally in the Antarctic holothurian Heterocucumis steineni (Ludwig 1898).
PG  - 556-69
AB  - Seasonal changes in protein and nitrogen metabolism have not previously been
      reported in any Antarctic suspension-feeding species that ceases feeding for
      extended periods in winter. To provide comparison with data reported on Nacella
      concinna, a species that continues to feed in winter, we have measured feeding
      activity; oxygen consumption; ammonia, urea, and fluorescamine-positive substance
      (FPS) excretion; O : N ratios; body wall protein synthesis; RNA to protein
      ratios; and RNA activity at three times during the year in an Antarctic
      suspension-feeding holothurian. Feeding activity ceased for 4 mo during winter,
      and oxygen consumption rates decreased from 8.79+/-0.43 micro mol h(-1) to
      4.48+/-0.34 micro mol h(-1). Ammonia excretion also decreased during winter from 
      2,600+/-177 nmol N h(-1) to 974+/-70 nmol N h(-1), but urea excretion rates
      increased from 178+/-36 nmol N h(-1) to 281+/-110 nmol N h(-1), while FPS
      excretion rates remained unchanged throughout the year with a seasonal mean of
      88+/-13 nmol N h(-1). Oxygen to nitrogen ratios ranged between 6 and 10,
      suggesting that proteins were used as the primary metabolic substrate. Body wall 
      protein synthesis rates decreased from 0.35%+/-0.03% d(-1) in summer to 0.23%
      d(-1) in winter, while RNA to protein ratios decreased from 33.10+/-1.0 microg
      RNA mg(-1) protein in summer to 27.88+/-1.3 microg RNA mg(-1) protein in winter, 
      and RNA activity was very low, ranging between 0.11+/-0.01 mg protein mg(-1) RNA 
      d(-1) in summer and 0.06+/-0.01 mg protein mg(-1) RNA d(-1) in winter.
      Heterocucumis steineni shows a larger seasonal decrease in oxygen consumption and
      ammonia excretion between February (summer) and July (winter) than N. concinna,
      while the proportional decrease in protein synthesis rates is similar in both
      species.

TI  - Diversity of antisense regulation in eukaryotes: multiple mechanisms, emerging
      patterns.
PG  - 664-71
AB  - High-throughput analysis of RNA molecules in multicellular eukaryotes has
      revealed an abundance of complementary antisense RNAs that are transcribed from
      separate or overlapping genes. In mammals these include many novel non-coding
      RNAs of unknown function. This unexpected complexity of the mammalian
      transcriptome suggests that expression of many genes is regulated
      post-transcriptionally by mechanisms mediated by RNA-RNA base pairing. The recent
      discovery of the widespread expression of microRNAs in animals and plants
      provides a prototypic example of such regulation in eukaryotes. However, there
      are likely to be numerous other types of antisense regulation in eukaryotes, many
      as yet uncharacterized.

PG  - 549-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the significance of quantitative analysis of Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis mRNA in the test of susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
      strains to rifampin. METHODS: The susceptibility to rifampin of fifty-three
      clinical isolated strains was test by the percentage of Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis 85B mRNA copies before and after the use of rifampin, and 1% and 10%
      were used as the standards for drug resistance, which was compared with the
      absolute concentration method. Among them, 29 were rifampin resistant strains and
      24 rifampin sensitive strains. RESULTS: When the concentration of rifampin was 1 
      micro g/ml, and 1% and 10% were used as the standards, the accuracy of
      quantitative analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis mRNA with the absolute
      concentration method was 70% and 81% respectively, and the sensitivity of
      quantitative analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis mRNA was 100% and 100%
      respectively, while the specificity of quantitative analysis of Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis mRNA was 33% and 58%. When the concentration of rifampin was 2 micro
      g/ml, the accuracy of quantitative analysis of mRNA with the absolute
      concentration method was 85% and 93% respectively, and the sensitivity was 100%
      and 97% respectively, while the specificity was 67% and 88% respectively. When
      the concentration of rifampin was 4 micro g/ml, the accuracy was 93% and 93%, and
      the sensitivity was 93% and 93%, while the specificity was 92% and 92%.
      CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis mRNA was a
      rapid, sensitive method in rifampin resistance screening. We suggest that the
      critical concentration of rifampin be 2 micro g/ml, and the critical proportion
      of mRNA copy be 10%.

PG  - 1294-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the possibility of phenotypic conversion of clinical
      chloromycetin (Cm)-resistant isolates of E.coli to drug-sensitive ones with
      external guide sequences (EGS) in vitro. METHODS: Recombinant EGS plasmids
      directed against Cm acetyl transferase (cat) and containing kanamycin (Km)
      drug-resistance gene and control plasmids only containing kanamycin-resistance
      gene without EGS were constructed. By using CaCl(2) method, the recombinant
      plasmids were introduced into the clinically isolated Cm-resistant E.coli
      strains. Extraction of plasmids and PCR were applied to identify the EGS positive
      clones; The growth rate in liquid broth culture of Cm-resistant bacteria after
      EGS containing plasmid transformation was determined by spectrophotometer A(600).
      Drug sensitivity was tested in solid culture by using KB method. RESULTS:
      Transformation studies were carried out on 16 clinically isolated Cm-resistant
      E.coli strains with pEGFP-C1-EGS + cat1 + cat2 recombinant plasmid. Transformants
      were screened on LB-agar plates containing Km after transformation using EGS. In 
      4 tested strains of them, transformants with specific EGS plasmid showed growth
      inhibition when grown in liquid broth culture containing 100 approximately 200
      micro g/ml of Cm. They were sensitive to Cm on LB-agar plates containing 100
      approximately 200 micro g/ml of Cm in drug-sensitivity test. Extraction of
      plasmids showed the existence of EGS bands. PCR amplified products of EGS. The
      above facts indicated that the 4 strains out of the 16 clinical isolates had been
      converted to drug-sensitive phenotype, and Cm-resistant clinically isolated E.
      coli resumed sensitivity to Cm. CONCLUSION: EGS has the capability of converting 
      the phenotype of clinical drug-resistant isolates to drug sensitivity.

AB  - The protective effect of synthetic serum thymic factor (FTS) nonapeptide on
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pancreatic cell damage in 10-week-old BALB/c
      male mice was investigated. Mice were divided into three groups. Group I was
      treated with LPS (10 micro g/head; i.p.) (LPS-treated mice). Group II was
      administered with FTS (50 micro g/head; i.p.) 24 hr before treatment with LPS and
      complemented immediately before LPS injection with FTS (50 micro g/head; i.p.)
      (FTS-administered mice). Group III was only treated with the same volume of
      saline (control mice). Treatment of LPS in vivo resulted in the destruction of
      pancreatic acinar cells. In those cells, many apoptotic cells were detected by
      immunohistochemistry using an anti-single stranded DNA antibody.
      Immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
      revealed that LPS treatment also caused low or a lack of insulin expression in
      pancreatic islets. In contrast, morphological change was not seen and apoptotic
      cell death was suppressed in pancreatic cells of FTS-administered mice. Moreover,
      insulin expression was normal in those mice. FTS administration enhanced
      expression of Bcl-2 mRNA levels in pancreatic tissues and IL-6 mRNA levels in
      splenocytes significantly compared with those of LPS treatment at 3 hr after LPS 
      injection. These findings suggest that FTS prevents LPS-induced cell damage via
      enhancing Bcl-2 expression in the pancreas and systemic IL-6 production.

TI  - Fast and effective prediction of microRNA/target duplexes.
PG  - 1507-17
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate the
      expression of target genes by binding to the target mRNAs. Although a large
      number of animal miRNAs has been defined, only a few targets are known. In
      contrast to plant miRNAs, which usually bind nearly perfectly to their targets,
      animal miRNAs bind less tightly, with a few nucleotides being unbound, thus
      producing more complex secondary structures of miRNA/target duplexes. Here, we
      present a program, RNA-hybrid, that predicts multiple potential binding sites of 
      miRNAs in large target RNAs. In general, the program finds the energetically most
      favorable hybridization sites of a small RNA in a large RNA. Intramolecular
      hybridizations, that is, base pairings between target nucleotides or between
      miRNA nucleotides are not allowed. For large targets, the time complexity of the 
      algorithm is linear in the target length, allowing many long targets to be
      searched in a short time. Statistical significance of predicted targets is
      assessed with an extreme value statistics of length normalized minimum free
      energies, a Poisson approximation of multiple binding sites, and the calculation 
      of effective numbers of orthologous targets in comparative studies of multiple
      organisms. We applied our method to the prediction of Drosophila miRNA targets in
      3'UTRs and coding sequence. RNAhybrid, with its accompanying programs
      RNAcalibrate and RNAeffective, is available for download and as a Web tool on the
      Bielefeld Bioinformatics Server

TI  - Mesophilic aerobic degradation of a metal lubricant by a biological consortium.
PG  - 620-6
AB  - The metal-forming industries require the use of greases to lubricate metal
      surfaces during manufacturing operations, and the residues of these lubricants
      must be removed prior to finishing processes to protect and improve the
      appearance of the final product. An aqueous, biological metal-cleaning process
      operating under mild conditions (pH 9, 42 degrees C) eliminates the use of
      environmentally unfriendly cleaning materials such as chlorinated solvents by
      employing microorganisms to degrade greases and oils naturally. This process was 
      characterized in terms of initial degradation rates of a representative metal
      lubricant and by phylogenetic identification of the active bacteria. The metal
      lubricant in a surfactant solution was degraded by a bacterial consortium, and
      its concentration was determined by a novel gas chromatography assay. The maximum
      degradation rate Vmax and the apparent Km were obtained as 45 mg/(day mg protein)
      and 24 g/l on cellular basis, and 4.6 g/(day l) and 33 g/l on a volumetric basis,
      respectively. Mineralization of the metal lubricant was shown by analyzing the
      evolved CO2 and Cl-, and the bacterial consortium utilized the metal lubricant as
      a sole carbon and energy source (micro=0.05+/-0.01 h(-1) at 0.5 vol% lubricant
      concentration). The active bacteria in the biological metal-cleaning process were
      identified as Bacillus licheniformis for the higher lubricant concentrations (3, 
      5, and 7.5 vol%), Bacillus cereus at 1 vol%, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
      Rhizobiaceae strain M100, and Achromobacter sp. LMG 5431 at 0.3 vol%.

TI  - Upregulation of fibronectin but not of entactin, collagen IV and smooth muscle
      actin by anaphylatoxin C5a in rat hepatic stellate cells.
PG  - 1165-74
AB  - Rat Kupffer cells (KC), hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and sinusoidal endothelial
      cells (SEC) all express the C5a receptor (C5aR) constitutively in contrast to
      hepatocytes (HC). HSC showed an unexpectedly high level of expression of the
      C5aR. As these cells are known to play a key role in the induction of liver
      fibrosis we hypothesized that C5a may possibly induce fibrogenetic proteins in
      these cells. HSC are known to express the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins
      collagen IV, fibronectin, entactin and the structure protein smooth muscle actin 
      (SMA) which is regarded as a marker for the fibrotic conversion of HSC to
      myofibroblast-like cells. We investigated the effect of recombinant rat C5a
      (rrC5a) on the upregulation of these ECM-proteins and of SMA, all of which are
      known to be expressed by HSC. The profibrotic cytokine TGF-beta1 (2 ng/ml), which
      was used as a control, clearly upregulated the three matrix proteins but not SMA.
      In the absence of any stimulus HSC upregulated the three ECM-proteins as well as 
      SMA during their conversion into myofibroblast-like cells. This resulted in a
      high stimulus-independent plateau of the mRNA expressions for all four proteins
      after four to five days of culture. Readouts were therefore taken at 72 h after
      the isolation of the HSC when the investigated mRNA levels had not yet reached
      their maxima due to the conversion of the cells. The first 24 h of culture were
      performed without stimulus and the following 48 h in the presence of 100 nM rrC5a
      (1 micro g/ml) or TGF-beta1 (2 ng/ml). Only fibronectin-specific mRNA was clearly
      upregulated by C5a whereas entactin, collagen IV and SMA were not affected by
      C5a. By competitive-quantitative PCR the upregulation of fibronectin-specific
      mRNA was determined to be about five-fold. As TGF-beta1 upregulated all of the
      three investigated ECM-proteins but not SMA it was checked as to whether C5a
      might act indirectly by upregulating the expression of TGF-beta1 in KC and HSC,
      as both cell types are known to be sources of this profibrotic cytokine. However,
      using RT-PCR, such an effect was not detectable in either cell type after 3, 10
      or 24 h.

TI  - MicroRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II.
PG  - 4051-60
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a large family of noncoding RNAs that function as
      guide molecules in diverse gene silencing pathways. Current efforts are focused
      on the regulatory function of miRNAs, while little is known about how these
      unusual genes themselves are regulated. Here we present the first direct evidence
      that miRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (pol II). The primary miRNA
      transcripts (pri-miRNAs) contain cap structures as well as poly(A) tails, which
      are the unique properties of class II gene transcripts. The treatment of human
      cells with alpha-amanitin decreased the level of pri-miRNAs at a concentration
      that selectively inhibits pol II activity. Furthermore, chromatin
      immunoprecipitation analyses show that pol II is physically associated with a
      miRNA promoter. We also describe, for the first time, the detailed structure of a
      miRNA gene by determining the promoter and the terminator of mir-23a
      approximately 27a approximately 24-2. These data indicate that pol II is the
      main, if not the only, RNA polymerase for miRNA gene transcription. Our study
      offers a basis for understanding the structure and regulation of miRNA genes.

TI  - RNA silencing in plants.
PG  - 356-63
AB  - There are at least three RNA silencing pathways for silencing specific genes in
      plants. In these pathways, silencing signals can be amplified and transmitted
      between cells, and may even be self-regulated by feedback mechanisms. Diverse
      biological roles of these pathways have been established, including defence
      against viruses, regulation of gene expression and the condensation of chromatin 
      into heterochromatin. We are now in a good position to investigate the full
      extent of this functional diversity in genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of
      genome control.

TI  - The functions of animal microRNAs.
PG  - 350-5
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that regulate the expression of complementary
      messenger RNAs. Hundreds of miRNA genes have been found in diverse animals, and
      many of these are phylogenetically conserved. With miRNA roles identified in
      developmental timing, cell death, cell proliferation, haematopoiesis and
      patterning of the nervous system, evidence is mounting that animal miRNAs are
      more numerous, and their regulatory impact more pervasive, than was previously
      suspected.

TI  - aRNA-longSAGE: a new approach to generate SAGE libraries from microdissected
      cells.
PG  - e131
AB  - Large-scale gene expression analyses of microdissected primary tissue are still
      difficult because generally only a limited amount of mRNA can be obtained from
      microdissected cells. The introduction of the T7-based RNA amplification
      technique was an important step to reduce the amount of RNA needed for such
      analyses. This amplification technique produces amplified antisense RNA (aRNA),
      which so far has precluded its direct use for serial analysis of gene expression 
      (SAGE) library production. We describe a method, termed 'aRNA-longSAGE', which is
      the first to allow the direct use of aRNA for standard longSAGE library
      production. The aRNA-longSAGE protocol was validated by comparing two
      aRNA-longSAGE libraries with two Micro-longSAGE libraries that were generated
      from the same RNA preparations of two different cell lines. Using a conservative 
      validation approach, we were able to verify 68% of the differentially expressed
      genes identified by aRNA-longSAGE. Furthermore, the identification rate of
      differentially expressed genes was roughly twice as high in our aRNA-longSAGE
      libraries as in the standard Micro-longSAGE libraries. Using our validated
      aRNA-longSAGE protocol, we were able to successfully generate longSAGE libraries 
      from as little as 40 ng of total RNA isolated from 2000-3000 microdissected
      pancreatic ductal epithelial cells or cells from pancreatic intraepithelial
      neoplasias.

TI  - In vivo investigation of the transcription, processing, endonucleolytic activity,
      and functional relevance of the spatial distribution of a plant miRNA.
PG  - 2237-42
AB  - We show, with miR171, that plant miRNA genes are modular independent
      transcription units in which the fold-back pre-miRNA is sufficient for miRNA
      processing, and that the upstream region contains highly specific promoter
      elements. Processing depends on flanking sequences within the miRNA stem-loop
      precursor rather than the miRNA sequence itself, and mutations affecting target
      pairing at the center and 5' but not 3' region of the miRNA compromise its
      function in vivo. Inactivation of the SDE1 RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase was
      mandatory for accurate representation of miRNA activity by sensor constructs in
      Arabidopsis. Work in sde1 background revealed a near-perfect spatial overlap
      between the patterns of miR171 transcription and activity, supporting the idea
      that plant miRNAs enable cell differentiation.

TI  - The brinker gradient controls wing growth in Drosophila.
PG  - 4921-30
AB  - The Decapentaplegic (Dpp) morphogen gradient controls growth and patterning in
      the Drosophila appendages. There is recent evidence indicating that the Dpp
      gradient is converted into an inverse gradient of activity of the gene brinker
      (brk), which encodes a transcriptional repressor and is negatively regulated by
      the Dpp pathway. We have studied how alterations in the Brk gradient affect the
      growth of the wing disc. We find that there is a negative correlation between brk
      activity and growth of the disc: high levels of brk prevent or reduce growth,
      whereas loss of brk activity results in excessive growth. This effect is
      concentration dependent: different amounts of Brk produce distinct rates of
      growth. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that although brk is able to induce 
      apoptosis where there is a sharp difference in Brk levels, its role as a growth
      repressor is not achieved by inducing apoptosis but by reducing cell
      proliferation. Brk appears to downregulate the activity of genes that control
      cell proliferation, such as bantam.

TI  - Inhibitory helix-loop-helix transcription factors Id1/Id3 promote bone formation 
      in vivo.
PG  - 337-44
AB  - Bone formation is under the control of a set of transcription factors. Ids are
      inhibitory helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcription factors and expression of Id
      genes in osteoblasts is under the control of calciotropic agents such as BMP and 
      vitamin D. However, the function of Ids during bone formation in vivo has not yet
      been elucidated. We, therefore, examined the role of Id1 and Id3 in the
      regulation of bone metabolism in vivo. Using wild type and Id1/Id3 heterozygous
      knockout mice, we analyzed calvarial bone formation in the suture by X-ray
      picture, proliferation, and mineralization activities of primary calvarial
      osteoblasts by MTT assay and alizarin red staining and onthotopic in vivo bone
      formation by BMP injection onto calvaria and micro CT analysis. The width of
      calvarial sutures was reduced by more than 50% in Id1/Id3 heterozygous knock out 
      mice. Analyses on the cellular basis for the mechanism underlying the defects in 
      the mutant mice revealed suppression of proliferation and mineralization in
      osteoblasts derived from Id1/Id3 heterozygous knock out mice. Furthermore,
      Id1/Id3 heterozygous knock out mice suppressed BMP-induced bone formation in
      vivo. These results indicated that Id1 and Id3 are positive factors to promote
      bone formation in vivo.

TI  - Identification of mammalian microRNA host genes and transcription units.
PG  - 1902-10
AB  - To derive a global perspective on the transcription of microRNAs (miRNAs) in
      mammals, we annotated the genomic position and context of this class of noncoding
      RNAs (ncRNAs) in the human and mouse genomes. Of the 232 known mammalian miRNAs, 
      we found that 161 overlap with 123 defined transcription units (TUs). We
      identified miRNAs within introns of 90 protein-coding genes with a broad spectrum
      of molecular functions, and in both introns and exons of 66 mRNA-like noncoding
      RNAs (mlncRNAs). In addition, novel families of miRNAs based on host gene
      identity were identified. The transcription patterns of all miRNA host genes were
      curated from a variety of sources illustrating spatial, temporal, and
      physiological regulation of miRNA expression. These findings strongly suggest
      that miRNAs are transcribed in parallel with their host transcripts, and that the
      two different transcription classes of miRNAs ('exonic' and 'intronic')
      identified here may require slightly different mechanisms of biogenesis.

TI  - [The role of Egr-1 and NF-kappaB in the pathogenesis of silicosis: an in-vitro
      study].
PG  - 363-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the correlation between the expression of Egr-1 and NF-kappaB
      and the up-regulation of TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 in macrophages after stimulation
      by silica in-vitro. METHODS: Macrophages were treated with antibodies against
      Egr-1 and NF-kappaB and antisense oligonucleotides. The level of TNF-alpha
      protein in the cell supernatant was then measured using enzyme-linked
      immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of TGF-beta1 protein was detected
      by immunocytochemistry. The expression of TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 mRNAs was also 
      monitored by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS:
      Compared with silica-stimulated macrophages untreated with antibodies, the cells 
      treated with 10 micro g/ml of Egr-1 or NF-kappaB antibodies were associated with 
      reduced expression of TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 proteins and mRNAs (P < 0.05).
      Compared with silica-stimulated untransfected group, the antisense group was
      associated with obvious reduction in the expression of TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1
      proteins and mRNAs (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The expression of TNF-alpha and
      TGF-beta1 mRNAs and proteins are associated with activation of Egr-1 and
      NF-kappaB in macrophages, after stimulation by silica. It is possible that the
      corresponding antibodies and antisense oligonucleotides may become a potential
      therapeutic tool in the management of silicosis in the future.

TI  - Identification of differentially expressed genes from spinal cord after firearm
      injury to rabbit sciatic nerves.
PG  - 294-300
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Peripheral nerve regeneration depends on gene regulation by central
      neurons. To search for more effective treatment methods to improve the
      regeneration of wounded peripheral nerves, gene expression profile of spinal cord
      after firearm injury to rabbit sciatic nerves are studied with DNA micro-array
      technique. METHODS: A total of 54 rabbits were randomly divided into 4 groups:
      Groups d1, d3, d7 and normal control group. Lumbar spinal cords were sampled. RNA
      and mRNA were extracted, labeled by Cy3 and Cy5, and analyzed by mouse_8192S gene
      chips. RESULTS: A total of 1367, 923, and 61 genes with differential expression
      were found on day 1, day 3, and day 7 after trauma respectively. Five expressed
      sequence tag (EST) sequences demonstrated differential expression during 7 days
      after trauma. CONCLUSIONS: There is complex gene profile with differential
      expression after firearm nerve injury, among which AW701496, U84291, W13926,
      X04017 and AW822394 EST sequences may be important regulation factors that
      involved in regeneration of peripheral nerve injury.

TI  - MicroRNA-responsive 'sensor' transgenes uncover Hox-like and other
      developmentally regulated patterns of vertebrate microRNA expression.
PG  - 1079-83
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short ( approximately 22-nt) noncoding RNA
      molecules that downregulate expression of their mRNA targets. Since their
      discovery as regulators of developmental timing in Caenorhabditis elegans,
      hundreds of miRNAs have been identified in both animals and plants. Here, we
      report a technique for visualizing detailed miRNA expression patterns in mouse
      embryos. We elucidate the tissue-specific expression of several miRNAs during
      embryogenesis, including two encoded by genes embedded in homeobox (Hox)
      clusters, miR-10a and miR-196a. These two miRNAs are expressed in patterns that
      are markedly reminiscent of those of Hox genes. Furthermore, miR-196a negatively 
      regulates Hoxb8, indicating that its restricted expression pattern probably
      reflects a role in the patterning function of the Hox complex.

AB  - AIMS: Enumeration of resistant bacteria in ultra-high temperature (UHT) treated
      milk; morphological characterization and phenotyping of resistant strains by
      traditional and nontraditional methods and their identification by molecular
      biology. METHODS AND RESULTS: Modified standard plate count agar (PCA) and
      modified brain-heart infusion (BHI) agar were used for colony counts.
      Physiological culture traits were determined as suggested by Bergey's Manual of
      Systematic Bacteriology or in modified J-broth or in modified BHI agar. Scanning 
      electron microscope (SEM) was used for microscopic examination. Strain
      identification was carried out by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 125
      (62.81% of 199) samples were positive and the bacterial load was higher than
      10(5) CFU ml(-1) in 46 samples (28.80% of 125). The 16S rRNA sequence of
      bacterial cultures obtained from UHT-treated milk was similar to that of Bacillus
      sporothermodurans M215 type strain((T)) and different biotypes were found by
      analysis of colony appearance, cell morphology and physiological traits.
      CONCLUSIONS: Bacillus sporothermodurans was the predominant sporigenous
      micro-organisms in UHT milk. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: BHI agar is
      more suitable than PCA for quality control of milk after UHT treatment. Modified 
      J-broth medium is useful to determine selected physiological traits of B.
      sporothermodurans. The strains characterized and identified as B.
      sporothermodurans were significantly different compared with the type strain.

PG  - 185-98
AB  - Small non-messenger RNAs (snmRNAs) are a heterogeneous group of non-coding RNAs
      with a variety of regulatory functions including regulation of protein expression
      and guidance in RNA modifications. They are actively being investigated in
      Archaebacteria, yeast, invertebrates and mammals. Brain-specific snmRNAs have
      been identified in mammals and they seem to contribute to neuronal
      differentiation during development and to brain functions subserving learning and
      memory. Here we review the current knowledge of the properties, expression and
      functions of three groups of brain-specific snmRNAs: small nucleolar RNAs,
      BC1/BC200 RNAs and microRNAs.

TI  - Structural requirements for pre-microRNA binding and nuclear export by Exportin
      5.
PG  - 4776-85
AB  - The biogenesis and function of mature human microRNAs is dependent on the nuclear
      export of pre-microRNA precursors by Exportin 5 (Exp5). The precursor for the
      human miR-30 microRNA, which is a 63 nt long RNA hairpin bearing a 2 nt 3'
      overhang, forms a specific complex with Exp5 and the Ran-GTP cofactor. Here, we
      have examined the structural requirements for pre-microRNA binding by Exp5. Our
      data indicate that pre-miR-30 binding requires an RNA stem of >16 bp and is
      facilitated by a 3' overhang. Although a blunt-ended derivative of the pre-miR-30
      stem-loop remained capable of binding Exp5, 5' overhangs were inhibitory. miR-30 
      variants that had lost the ability to bind Exp5 effectively were not efficiently 
      exported from the nucleus and were also expressed at reduced levels. Furthermore,
      formation of a pre-microRNA/Exp5/Ran-GTP complex inhibited exonucleolytic
      digestion of the pre-miRNA in vitro. Together, these data demonstrate that
      pre-microRNA binding by Exp5 involves recognition of almost all of the RNA
      hairpin, with the exception of the terminal loop. Moreover, these results argue
      that Exp5 binding not only mediates pre-microRNA nuclear export but also prevents
      nuclear pre-microRNA degradation.

TI  - Altered emotional behaviors and the expression of 5-HT1A and M1 muscarinic
      receptors in micro-opioid receptor knockout mice.
PG  - 72-82
AB  - Anxiety and depression alterations have been reported in micro-opioid receptor
      knockout mice after exon 2 disruption. However, emotional behaviors, such as
      novelty and emergence responses have not been reported in micro-opioid receptor
      knockout mice due to the disruptions of exon 2 and 3. Here, we report that
      mu-opioid receptor knockout mice, with deletion of exon 2 and 3, display
      significant emotional behavior changes; they showed less anxiety in the elevated 
      plus maze and emergence tests, reduced response to novel stimuli in the novelty
      test, and less depressive-like behavior in the forced-swim test. Analysis of the 
      compensatory mechanism in mu-opioid receptor knockout mice revealed that the M1
      mRNA levels were reduced in the cortex, caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, and
      hippocampus, and that M1 receptor levels were reduced in the nucleus accumbens,
      CA1, and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, versus the wild-type. However,
      5-HT1A receptor levels were significantly elevated in the cerebral cortex and in 
      the hypothalamus of mu-opioid receptor knockout mice versus the wild-type. These 
      aberrant emotional behavioral phenotypes are possibly related to M1 and 5-HT1A
      receptor alterations in the micro-opioid receptor knockout mice. Overall, our
      study suggests that micro-opioid receptor may play a role in the modification of 
      emotional responses to novelty, anxiety, and depression.

TI  - Class III HD-Zip gene regulation, the golden fleece of ARGONAUTE activity?
PG  - 938-42
AB  - MicroRNAs, small noncoding RNAs, are implicated in gene regulation in both
      metazoans and plants. In plants, many of the targets of miRNA-mediated gene
      regulation encode transcription factors with functions in development, such as
      the Class III HD-Zip gene family whose members direct polarity establishment in
      leaves and vasculature. Three recent papers provide insight into how miRNAs,
      likely acting through a complex containing an Argonaute protein, regulate Class
      III HD-Zip gene expression in Arabidopsis and maize.1-3 While the precise
      biological activity of Argonaute proteins remains an enigma, ARGONAUTE1 in
      Arabidopsis is required for the proper regulation of miRNA165/166, which targets 
      cleavage of Class III HD-Zip mRNAs. Consistent with their proposed role in
      negative regulation, expression of miRNA165/166 is complementary to that of Class
      III HD-Zip gene expression, but this is perturbed in agronaute1 mutants.
      Determining how these complementary patterns of expression are formed should lead
      us closer to an understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which asymmetry is
      established in developing leaves.

      gene expression. Indeed, since its initial discovery, siRNA has been rapidly
      deployed for the elucidation of gene function and the identification of potential
      drug targets, a process often known as target discovery. In this review, we
      briefly discuss the mechanism of RNA interference and then critically examine the
      use of siRNA in target discovery, with a particular emphasis upon issues such as 
      efficacy, selectivity, delivery and application in high-throughput studies.

TI  - Characterization of anti-inflammatory compounds using transcriptomics,
      proteomics, and metabolomics in combination with multivariate data analysis.
PG  - 1499-514
AB  - The discovery of new anti-inflammatory drugs is often based on an interaction
      with a specific target, although other pathways often play a primary or secondary
      role. Anti-inflammatory drugs can be categorized into classes, based on their
      mechanism of action. In this article we investigate the possibility to
      characterize novel anti-inflammatory compounds by three holistic methods. For
      this purpose, we make use of macrophage-like U937 cells which are stimulated with
      LPS in the absence or presence of an anti-inflammatory compound. Using
      micro-arrays, 2-D gel electrophoresis and a LC-MS method for lipids the effects
      on the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of the exposed cells is
      investigated. The expression patterns are subsequently analyzed using in-house
      developed pattern recognition tools. Using the methods described above, we have
      examined the effects of six anti-inflammatory compounds. Our results demonstrate 
      that different classes of anti-inflammatory compounds show distinct and
      characteristic mRNA, protein, and lipid expression patterns, which can be used to
      categorise known molecules and to discover and classify new leads. The potential 
      of our approach is illustrated by the analysis of several beta (2)-adrenergic
      agonists (beta2-agonists). In addition to their primary pharmacological target,
      beta2-agonists posses certain anti-inflammatory properties. We were able to show 
      that zilpaterol, a poorly characterized beta2-agonist, gives rise to an almost
      identical expression pattern as the beta2-agonists clenbuterol and salbutamol.
      Furthermore we have identified specific mRNA, protein and lipid markers for the
      anti-inflammatory compounds investigated in this study.

TI  - Use of serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) technology reveals new
      granulocytic markers.
PG  - 43-58
AB  - Because of its short life span in blood, its low RNA content and its highly
      condensed nucleus, the granulocyte was initially considered as a terminally
      differentiated cell unable to express novel genes. However, mature granulocytes
      still contain a variety of mRNAs and may respond to external stimuli by rapid and
      complex changes in gene expression. The present work was undertaken to provide a 
      wider view of the gene expression profile in unstimulated circulating PMNs. We
      used serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) adapted to downsized extracts
      (SADE) to cope with their small mRNA content. As cell samples of the highest
      degree of purity were crucial for this project, we adapted a magnetic cell
      sorting method to reach the required high levels of purity (99.55 +/- 0.19%)
      together with low activation rates (1.37 +/- 0.28). We analyzed 20,787 tags
      identifying 8547 different transcripts, of which 47.8% were unknown, 34.6% were
      transcripts of known genes, and 13.8% matched with expressed sequence tags (EST).
      Highly expressed genes were those involved in cell mobility, diapedesis, cell
      signaling and destruction of micro-organisms. In addition, this method led to the
      identification of genes which had not previously been reported in granulocytes.
      These results could provide new molecular markers and a reliable reference for
      the investigation of pathologies involving alteration of the granulocyte gene
      expression profile.

TI  - Nitric oxide modulates the physiological control of ciliary activity in the
      marine mussel Mytilus edulis via morphine: novel mu opiate receptor splice
      variants.
PG  - 184-90
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The study sought to determine how dopamine controls ganglionic
      processes involved with modulating lateral cilia beating via the peripheral
      branchial nerve. METHODS: The lateral cilia found on the gill filaments exhibit
      metachronal ciliary beating determined stroboscopically. Novel opiate receptors
      were determined pharmacologically and demonstrated by RT-PCR and sequence
      analysis of total RNA from Mytilus edulis visceral ganglia. RESULTS: Dopamine
      applied to the visceral ganglion inhibits the activity of lateral cilia in a
      concentration and haloperidol sensitive manner. Morphine or DAMGO significantly
      enhances ciliary beating in a naloxone sensitive manner, whereas L-NAME, a nitric
      oxide synthase inhibitor, only antagonized morphine's action. SNAP, a nitric
      oxide donor, also enhanced lateral ciliary beating rates. Supporting the
      observation, i.e., morphine sensitive nitric oxide enhancement of ciliary beating
      and DAMGO insensitive, that two different mu opiate receptors are present in this
      tissue, a 602 bp fragment of the human micro 3 opiate receptor and a 935 bp
      fragment, designated micro 4 have been demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: The lateral
      epithelium of the gill is innervated by serotonergic, cilioexcitatory neurons and
      dopaminergic, cilioinhibitory neurons, originating in the visceral ganglion. This
      data supports previous reports that demonstrate inhibiting ganglionic dopamine
      release allows the serotonin signals to prevail uncontrolled, enhancing ciliary
      rates. Supporting the observation that two different mu opiate receptors are
      present in this tissue, evidence is presented that identifies a 602 bp fragment
      of the human micro 3 opiate receptor and a 935 bp fragment, designated micro 4.
      Overall, the data strongly suggests that the two alternatively spliced mu opiate 
      receptors may be involved in the physiological regulation of lateral ciliary
      activity in the visceral ganglia via dopamine and nitric oxide.

TI  - In situ monitoring of streptothricin production by Streptomyces rochei F20 in
      soil and rhizosphere.
PG  - 5222-8
AB  - The onset of streptothricin (ST) biosynthesis in Streptomyces rochei F20 was
      studied by using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) to detect transcripts of ST
      genes during growth in liquid medium, soil, and the rhizosphere. In situ results 
      correlated with those obtained in vitro, illustrating the growth phase-dependent 
      manner of ST production by F20. Maximal transcription of ST resistance (sttR) and
      biosynthesis (sttA) genes occurred during the transition between the exponential 
      and stationary phases of growth, when the specific growth rate (micro) started to
      decline. A higher level of gene expression of sttR versus sttA was observed in
      all experiments. In liquid culture, maximal transcript accumulation of the sttA
      gene was only ca. 40% that of the sttR gene. sttA and sttR mRNAs were detected in
      soil containing approximately 10(6) CFU of growing cells g of soil(-1). sttR mRNA
      was detected in sterile and nonsterile rhizosphere colonized with growing
      mycelium of F20 at 1.2 x 10(6) and 4.0 x 10(5) CFU g of soil(-1), respectively.
      However, neither sttR nor sttA transcripts were detected by RT-PCR in the
      rhizoplane, which supported a lower population density of F20 than the
      rhizosphere.

TI  - Microarray analysis of microRNA expression in the developing mammalian brain.
PG  - R68
AB  - BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs are a large new class of tiny regulatory RNAs found in
      nematodes, plants, insects and mammals. MicroRNAs are thought to act as
      post-transcriptional modulators of gene expression. In invertebrates microRNAs
      have been implicated as regulators of developmental timing, neuronal
      differentiation, cell proliferation, programmed cell death and fat metabolism.
      Little is known about the roles of microRNAs in mammals. RESULTS: We isolated
      18-26 nucleotide RNAs from developing rat and monkey brains. From the sequences
      of these RNAs and the sequences of the rat and human genomes we determined which 
      of these small RNAs are likely to have derived from stem-loop precursors typical 
      of microRNAs. Next, we developed a microarray technology suitable for detecting
      microRNAs and printed a microRNA microarray representing 138 mammalian microRNAs 
      corresponding to the sequences of the microRNAs we cloned as well as to other
      known microRNAs. We used this microarray to determine the profile of microRNAs
      expressed in the developing mouse brain. We observed a temporal wave of
      expression of microRNAs, suggesting that microRNAs play important roles in the
      development of the mammalian brain. CONCLUSION: We describe a microarray
      technology that can be used to analyze the expression of microRNAs and of other
      small RNAs. MicroRNA microarrays offer a new tool that should facilitate studies 
      of the biological roles of microRNAs. We used this method to determine the
      microRNA expression profile during mouse brain development and observed a
      temporal wave of gene expression of sequential classes of microRNAs.

TI  - Prediction and identification of Arabidopsis thaliana microRNAs and their mRNA
      targets.
PG  - R65
AB  - BACKGROUND: A class of eukaryotic non-coding RNAs termed microRNAs (miRNAs)
      interact with target mRNAs by sequence complementarity to regulate their
      expression. The low abundance of some miRNAs and their time- and tissue-specific 
      expression patterns make experimental miRNA identification difficult. We present 
      here a computational method for genome-wide prediction of Arabidopsis thaliana
      microRNAs and their target mRNAs. This method uses characteristic features of
      known plant miRNAs as criteria to search for miRNAs conserved between Arabidopsis
      and Oryza sativa. Extensive sequence complementarity between miRNAs and their
      target mRNAs is used to predict miRNA-regulated Arabidopsis transcripts. RESULTS:
      Our prediction covered 63% of known Arabidopsis miRNAs and identified 83 new
      miRNAs. Evidence for the expression of 25 predicted miRNAs came from northern
      blots, their presence in the Arabidopsis Small RNA Project database, and
      massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) data. Putative targets
      functionally conserved between Arabidopsis and O. sativa were identified for most
      newly identified miRNAs. Independent microarray data showed that the expression
      levels of some mRNA targets anti-correlated with the accumulation pattern of
      their corresponding regulatory miRNAs. The cleavage of three target mRNAs by
      miRNA binding was validated in 5' RACE experiments. CONCLUSIONS: We identified
      new plant miRNAs conserved between Arabidopsis and O. sativa and report a wide
      range of transcripts as potential miRNA targets. Because MPSS data are generated 
      from polyadenylated RNA molecules, our results suggest that at least some miRNA
      precursors are polyadenylated at certain stages. The broad range of putative
      miRNA targets indicates that miRNAs participate in the regulation of a variety of
      biological processes.

TI  - Trans-splicing and polyadenylation of let-7 microRNA primary transcripts.
PG  - 1586-94
AB  - Members of the microRNA (miRNA) class of 22-nucleotide RNAs regulate the
      expression of target genes that contain sequences of antisense complementarity.
      Maturation of miRNAs involves cleavage of longer primary transcripts, but little 
      is yet understood about how miRNA genes are transcribed and enter the processing 
      pathway. We find that relatively long, polyadenylated transcripts encoded by the 
      Caenorhabditis elegans let-7 gene undergo trans-splicing to the spliced leader 1 
      (SL1) RNA. Deletions, including removal of the trans-splice site, upstream of
      mature let-7 sequence result in stable accumulation of primary transcripts and
      compromised production of mature let-7 RNA in vivo. Our data show that multiple
      steps of let-7 miRNA biogenesis can be uncoupled, allowing for complex regulation
      in the production of a functional miRNA. Finally, the observation that let-7
      primary transcripts undergo splicing highlights the importance of identifying the
      sequence of endogenous pri-miRNA substrates recognized by the cellular processing
      machinery.

TI  - Tethering of human Ago proteins to mRNA mimics the miRNA-mediated repression of
      protein synthesis.
PG  - 1518-25
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 21-nt-long RNAs involved in regulating
      development, differentiation, and other processes in eukaryotes. In metazoa,
      nearly all miRNAs control gene expression by imperfectly base-pairing with the
      3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of target mRNAs and repressing protein synthesis 
      by an unknown mechanism. It is also unknown whether miRNA-mRNA duplexes
      containing mismatches and bulges provide specific features that are recognized by
      factors mediating the repression. miRNAs form part of ribonucleoprotein
      complexes, miRNPs, that contain Argonaute (Ago) and other proteins. Here we
      demonstrate that effects of miRNAs on translation can be mimicked in human HeLa
      cells by the miRNA-independent tethering of Ago proteins to the 3'-UTR of a
      reporter mRNA. Inhibition of protein synthesis occurred without a change in the
      reporter mRNA level and was dependent on the number, but not the position, of the
      hairpins tethering hAgo2 to the 3'-UTR. These findings indicate that a primary
      function of miRNAs is to guide their associated proteins to the mRNA.

TI  - Genomic approaches that aid in the identification of transcription factor target 
      genes.
PG  - 705-21
AB  - It is well-established that deregulation of the transcriptional activity of many 
      different genes has been causatively linked to human diseases. In cancer, altered
      patterns of gene expression are often the result of the inappropriate expression 
      of a specific transcriptional activator or repressor. Functional studies of
      cancer-specific transcription factors have relied upon the study of candidate
      target genes. More recently, gene expression profiling using DNA microarrays that
      contain tens of thousands of cDNAs corresponding to human mRNAs has allowed for a
      large-scale identification of genes that respond to increased or decreased levels
      of a particular transcription factor. However, such experiments do not
      distinguish direct versus indirect target genes. Coupling chromatin
      immunoprecipitation to micro-arrays that contain genomic regions (ChIP-chip) has 
      provided investigators with the ability to identify, in a high-throughput manner,
      promoters directly bound by specific transcription factors. Clearly, knowledge
      gained from both types of arrays provides complementary information, allowing
      greater confidence that a transcription factor regulates a particular gene. In
      this review, we focus on Polycomb group (PcG) complexes as an example of
      transcriptional regulators that are implicated in various cellular processes but 
      about which very little is known concerning their target gene specificity. We
      provide examples of how both expression arrays and ChIP-chip microarray-based
      assays can be used to identify target genes of a particular PcG complex and
      suggest improvements in the application of array technology for faster and more
      comprehensive identification of directly regulated target genes.

TI  - Common logic of transcription factor and microRNA action.
PG  - 462-8
AB  - Over the past few years, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as abundant regulators
      of gene expression. Like many transcription factors (TFs), miRNAs are important
      determinants of cellular fate specification. Here I provide a conceptual
      framework for miRNA action in the context of creating cellular diversity in a
      developing organism, and emphasize the conceptual similarity of TF- and
      miRNA-mediated control of gene expression. Both TFs and miRNAs are trans-acting
      factors that exert their activity through composite cis-regulatory elements that 
      are 'hard-wired' into DNA or RNA. TFs and miRNAs act in a largely combinatorial
      manner - that is, many different TFs or miRNAs control one gene - and they act
      cooperatively on their targets - that is, there are several cis-regulatory
      elements for a single TF or miRNA species in a target gene. Just as the set of
      TFs in a given cell type has been proposed to constitute a 'code' that specifies 
      cellular differentiation, so 'miRNA codes' are likely to have conceptually
      similar roles in the specification of cell types.

      morphogenesis.
PG  - 575-81
AB  - The past year has seen major advances in delineating the regulatory circuits that
      control leaf morphogenesis. Regulation of auxin transporters is pivotal in
      generating auxin gradients that define the sites of leaf inception. In addition, 
      auxin acts via the ARGOS protein to regulate leaf size. HD-ZIPIII transcription
      factors controlled by micro-RNAs are required to specify adaxial identity in the 
      leaf and vasculature. Elaboration of final leaf shape also depends on the
      regulated arrest of cell division, and the TCP and JAGGED transcription factors
      are key regulators of this process. Furthermore, the juxtaposition of abaxial and
      adaxial identities regulates leaflet placement in dissected leaf species.

AB  - It has only been a few years since we began to appreciate that microRNAs provide 
      an unanticipated level of gene regulation in both plants and metazoans. The high 
      level of complementarity between plant microRNAs and their target mRNAs has
      allowed rapid progress towards the elucidation of their varied biological
      functions. MicroRNAs have been shown to regulate diverse developmental processes,
      including organ separation, polarity, and identity, and to modulate their own
      biogenesis and function. Recently, they have also been implicated in some
      processes outside of plant development.

TI  - Rapid identification of pickle yeasts by fluorescent PCR and
      microtemperature-gradient gel electrophoresis.
PG  - 43-8
AB  - Monitoring the yeast populations within pickle soaking fluid is imperative for
      ensuring optimum taste, but these analyses have proven time-consuming and
      expensive, limiting their industrial application. Here, yeasts were identified in
      the soaking fluid from Japanese radish pickles using fluorescent PCR
      amplification of the variable D1/D2 region of the 26S rDNA, followed by analysis 
      with microtemperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (micro-TGGE). This smaller
      version of the normal TGGE apparatus is capable of analyzing samples 10- to
      20-fold faster without sacrificing data quality. Each primer set was labeled with
      a different fluorescent dye, allowing easy isolation of the various PCR products 
      and identification of the bands corresponding to the various yeasts. The results 
      indicate that fluorescent PCR and micro-TGGE may be a useful new method for
      rapid, easy monitoring of yeast flora in various food industries. This new method
      can be used on a daily basis to provide overviews of yeast flora during pickle
      production, allowing producers to quickly grasp pickle readiness at a single
      glance.

TI  - Molecular clock in neutral protein evolution.
PG  - 25
AB  - BACKGROUND: A frequent observation in molecular evolution is that amino-acid
      substitution rates show an index of dispersion (that is, ratio of variance to
      mean) substantially larger than one. This observation has been termed the
      overdispersed molecular clock. On the basis of in silico protein-evolution
      experiments, Bastolla and coworkers recently proposed an explanation for this
      observation: Proteins drift in neutral space, and can temporarily get trapped in 
      regions of substantially reduced neutrality. In these regions, substitution rates
      are suppressed, which results in an overall substitution process that is not
      Poissonian. However, the simulation method of Bastolla et al. is representative
      only for cases in which the product of mutation rate micro and population size Ne
      is small. How the substitution process behaves when micro Ne is large is not
      known. RESULTS: Here, I study the behavior of the molecular clock in in silico
      protein evolution as a function of mutation rate and population size. I find that
      the index of dispersion decays with increasing micro Ne, and approaches 1 for
      large micro Ne. This observation can be explained with the selective pressure for
      mutational robustness, which is effective when micro Ne is large. This pressure
      keeps the population out of low-neutrality traps, and thus steadies the ticking
      of the molecular clock. CONCLUSIONS: The molecular clock in neutral protein
      evolution can fall into two distinct regimes, a strongly overdispersed one for
      small micro Ne, and a mostly Poissonian one for large micro Ne. The former is
      relevant for the majority of organisms in the plant and animal kingdom, and the
      latter may be relevant for RNA viruses.

TI  - Using RNAi to improve plant nutritional value: from mechanism to application.
PG  - 463-9
AB  - RNA interference (RNAi) is an ancient mechanism of gene suppression, whose
      machinery and biological functions are only partially understood. Intensive
      studies have focused on developing RNAi technologies for treating human diseases 
      and for improving plant traits. Yet application of RNAi to improving the
      nutritional value of plants for human and animal nutrition, and development of
      the related RNAi technologies are still in their infancy. Here we discuss current
      knowledge of plant RNAi function, as well as concepts and strategies for the
      improvement of plant nutritional value through the development of plant RNAi
      technologies.

TI  - Recognition of duplex RNA by helix-threading peptides.
PG  - 10603-10
AB  - Many important biological processes, from the interferon antiviral response to
      the generation of microRNA regulators of translation, involve duplex RNA. Small
      molecules capable of binding duplex RNA structures with high affinity and
      selectivity will be useful in regulating these processes and, as such, are
      valuable research tools and potentially therapeutic. In this paper, the synthesis
      and duplex RNA-binding properties of EDTA.Fe-modified peptide-intercalator
      conjugates (PICs) are described. Peptide appendages at the 4- and 9-positions of 
      the planar acridine ring system render these PICs threading intercalators,
      directing the substituents into both grooves of double helical RNA
      simultaneously. Directed hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments conducted with
      varying RNA stem-loop structures indicate a preferred binding polarity with the
      N- and C-termini of the PIC in the minor and major grooves, respectively.
      However, this binding polarity is shown to be dependent on both the structure of 
      the PIC and the RNA secondary structure adjacent to the intercalation site.
      Definition of the minimal RNA structure required for binding to one of these PICs
      led to the identification of an intercalation site in a pre-microRNA from
      Caenorhabditis elegans. Results presented will guide both rational design and
      combinatorial approaches for the generation of new RNA binding PICs and will
      continue to facilitate the identification of naturally occurring RNA targets for 
      these small molecules.

TI  - Identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by PCR-linked reverse hybridization 
      using specific rpoB oligonucleotide probes.
PG  - 71-9
AB  - A reverse probe hybridization method using two different Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis-specific rpoB DNA probes in combination was evaluated for the
      identification of M. tuberculosis culture isolates. Among the 384 isolates
      tested, 354 strains were identified as M. tuberculosis, which included 37
      rifampin-resistant strains, and 30 were nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). This
      result was in accord with partial rpoB sequence analysis and IS6110 polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) results, but not with the results of biochemical testing,
      which produced two false negative results. Because of its high level of
      sensitivity and specificity, we suggest that M. tuberculosis-specific rpoB probes
      immobilized on micro-titer well plates or on other solid matrixes can be used
      efficiently for the rapid and convenient identification of M. tuberculosis.

TI  - Altered expression profiles of microRNAs during TPA-induced differentiation of
      HL-60 cells.
PG  - 403-10
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene 
      expression through translational repression by base-pairing with partially
      complementary mRNAs. The expression of a set of miRNAs is known to be regulated
      developmentally and spatially, and is involved in differentiation or cell
      proliferation in several organisms. However, the expression profiles of human
      miRNAs during cell differentiation remain largely unknown. In an effort to expand
      our knowledge of human miRNAs, we investigated miRNAs during
      12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced differentiation of human
      leukemia cells (HL-60) into monocyte/macrophage-like cells. Several hundred RNAs 
      ranging from 18 to 26 nucleotides were isolated from HL-60 cells with or without 
      TPA-induction, and subsequently characterized by sequencing, database searching, 
      and expression profiling. By removing non-miRNA sequences, we found three novel
      and 38 known miRNAs expressed in HL-60 cells. These miRNAs could be further
      classified into subsets of miRNAs that responded differently following TPA
      induction, either being up-regulated or down-regulated, suggesting the importance
      of regulated gene expression via miRNAs in the differentiation of HL-60 cells.

TI  - Patterns of flanking sequence conservation and a characteristic upstream motif
      for microRNA gene identification.
PG  - 1309-22
AB  - MicroRNAs are approximately 22-nucleotide (nt) RNAs processed from foldback
      segments of endogenous transcripts. Some are known to play important gene
      regulatory roles during animal and plant development by pairing to the messages
      of protein-coding genes to direct the post-transcriptional repression of these
      messages. Previously, we developed a computational method called MiRscan, which
      scores features related to the foldbacks, and used this algorithm to identify new
      miRNA genes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In the present study, to
      identify sequences that might be involved in processing or transcriptional
      regulation of miRNAs, we aligned sequences upstream and downstream of orthologous
      nematode miRNA foldbacks. These alignments showed a pronounced peak in sequence
      conservation about 200 bp upstream of the miRNA foldback and revealed a highly
      significant sequence motif, with consensus CTCCGCCC, that is present upstream of 
      almost all independently transcribed nematode miRNA genes. Scoring the pattern of
      upstream/downstream conservation, the occurrence of this sequence motif, and
      orthology of host genes for intronic miRNA candidates, yielded substantial
      improvements in the accuracy of MiRscan. Nine new C. elegans miRNA gene
      candidates were validated using a PCR-sequencing protocol. As previously seen for
      bacterial RNA genes, sequence features outside of the RNA secondary structure can
      therefore be very useful for the computational identification of eukaryotic
      noncoding RNA genes. The total number of confidently identified nematode miRNAs
      now approaches 100. The improved analysis supports our previous assertion that
      miRNA gene identification is nearing completion in C. elegans with apparently no 
      more than 20 miRNA genes now remaining to be identified.

TI  - The N-terminal half-domain of the long form of tRNase Z is required for the RNase
      65 activity.
PG  - 4429-38
AB  - Transfer RNA (tRNA) 3' processing endoribonuclease (tRNase Z) is an enzyme
      responsible for the removal of a 3' trailer from pre-tRNA. There exists two types
      of tRNase Z: one is a short form (tRNase ZS) that consists of 300-400 amino
      acids, and the other is a long form (tRNase ZL) that contains 800-900 amino
      acids. Here we investigated whether the short and long forms have different
      preferences for various RNA substrates. We examined three recombinant tRNase ZSs 
      from human, Escherichia coli and Thermotoga maritima, two recombinant tRNase ZLs 
      from human and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, one tRNase ZL from pig liver, and the N-
      and C-terminal half regions of human tRNase ZL for cleavage of human
      micro-pre-tRNA(Arg) and the RNase 65 activity. All tRNase ZLs cleaved the
      micro-pre-tRNA and showed the RNase 65 activity, while all tRNase ZSs and both
      half regions of human tRNase ZL failed to do so with the exception of the
      C-terminal half, which barely cleaved the micro-pre-tRNA. We also show that only 
      the long forms of tRNase Z can specifically cleave a target RNA under the
      direction of a new type of small guide RNA, hook RNA. These results indicate that
      indeed tRNase ZL and tRNase ZS have different substrate specificities and that
      the differences are attributed to the N-terminal half-domain of tRNase ZL.
      Furthermore, the optimal concentrations of NaCl, MgCl2 and MnCl2 differed between
      tRNase ZSs and tRNase ZLs, and the K(m) values implied that tRNase ZLs interact
      with pre-tRNA substrates more strongly than tRNase ZSs.

TI  - TLR2 mRNA upregulation in ischemic lobes in mouse partial hepatic
      ischemia/reperfusion injury model.
PG  - 144-6
AB  - To investigate TLR2 (Toll-like receptor 2) mRNA expression in ischemic hepatic
      lobes under the condition of partial hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury in
      BALB/c mice and its relationship with liver function impairment. A partial
      ischemia/reperfusion injury model was established. The portal vein and hepatic
      artery supply to the median and left lobes of the liver were obstructed by an
      atraumatic artery micro-clip, with the obstruction lasting for about 60 min. Then
      reperfusion was fulfilled by removal of the clip. The liver samples were
      collected at the 4th h after the restoration of blood inflow. Total RNA was
      extracted from the liver samples and analyzed quantitatively by method of
      real-time PCR. At the same time, portal vein serum and plasma were taken
      respectively for further detection of the level of endotoxin, tumor necrosis
      factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and plasmic alanine aminotransferase (pALT). The results
      indicated that TLR2 mRNA in ischemic lobe was up-regulated markedly in mice
      partial liver ischemia/reperfusion injury model compared to that in sham
      operation group (deltaCt: 1.05 +/- 1.02 vs 5.08 +/- 1.36, P<0.001). The level of 
      portal vein pALT and TNF-alpha increased significantly (112.32 +/- 17.56 pg/ml vs
      6.07 +/- 5.33 pg/ml, P<0.01; 890 +/- 127 microm/L vs 30 +/- 5 microm/L, P<0.001) 
      . However, the level of portal vein endotoxin remained below the normal line,
      suggesting a state of non-endotoxemia. TLR2 mRNA expression in ischemic lobe, as 
      well as portal vein pALT and TNF-alpha, was up-regulated in the model of mice
      partial ischemia/reperfusion injury, suggesting the involvement of TLR2 in
      ischemia/reperfusion pathological process.

TI  - Arabidopsis micro-RNA biogenesis through Dicer-like 1 protein functions.
PG  - 12753-8
AB  - Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs of 18-25 nt in length that
      negatively regulate their complementary mRNAs at the posttranscriptional level.
      Previous work has shown that some RNase III-like enzymes such as Drosha and Dicer
      are known to be involved in miRNA biogenesis in animals. However, the mechanism
      of plant miRNA biogenesis still remains poorly understood. In this article, the
      process of Arabidopsis miR163 biogenesis was examined. The results revealed that 
      two types of miR163 primary transcripts (pri-miR163s) are transcribed from a
      single gene by RNA polymerase II and that miR163 biogenesis requires at least
      three cleavage steps by RNase III-like enzymes at 21-nt-long intervals. The first
      step is from pri-miR163 to long miR163 precursor (premiR163), the second step is 
      from long pre-miR163 to short premiR163, and the last step is from short
      pre-miR163 to mature miR163 and the remnant. It is interesting that, during the
      process, four small RNAs including miR163 are released. By using dcl1 mutants, it
      was demonstrated that Arabidopsis Dicer homologue Dicer-like 1 (DCL1) catalyzes
      at least the first and second cleavage steps and that double-stranded RNA-binding
      domains of DCL1 are involved in positioning of the cleavage sites. Our result is 
      direct evidence that DCL1 is involved in processing of pri- and pre-miRNA.

TI  - A large imprinted microRNA gene cluster at the mouse Dlk1-Gtl2 domain.
PG  - 1741-8
AB  - microRNAs (or miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs (21 to 25 nucleotides) that are
      processed from longer hairpin RNA precursors and are believed to be involved in a
      wide range of developmental and cellular processes, by either repressing
      translation or triggering mRNA degradation (RNA interference). By using a
      computer-assisted approach, we have identified 46 potential miRNA genes located
      in the human imprinted 14q32 domain, 40 of which are organized as a large
      cluster. Although some of these clustered miRNA genes appear to be encoded by a
      single-copy DNA sequence, most of them are arranged in tandem arrays of closely
      related sequences. In the mouse, this miRNA gene cluster is conserved at the
      homologous distal 12 region. In vivo all the miRNAs that we have detected are
      expressed in the developing embryo (both in the head and in the trunk) and in the
      placenta, whereas in the adult their expression is mainly restricted to the
      brain. We also show that the miRNA genes are only expressed from the maternally
      inherited chromosome and that their imprinted expression is regulated by an
      intergenic germline-derived differentially methylated region (IG-DMR) located
      approximately 200 kb upstream from the miRNA cluster. The functions of these
      miRNAs, which seem only conserved in mammals, are discussed both in terms of
      epigenetic control and gene regulation during development.

TI  - [Corneal epithelial wound healing is delayed by platelet activating factor
      treatment].
PG  - 151-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of PAF in corneal epithelial wound healing and
      its mechanisms. METHODS: Rabbit corneal epithelial (RCE) and keratocyte (RCK)
      cells were cultured and used at passage 2 to 3. For the in vitro wound healing
      experiments, a 7 mm central corneal de-epithelialization was performed in rabbit 
      corneas. Corneas were incubated in the presence of 100 nmol/L PAF; 4 micro mol/L 
      of the PAF antagonist BN was added 30 min before PAF. The area of the cornea
      uncovered by the epithelium was measured after 48 h using an imaging system. Cell
      adhesion, proliferation and migration were analyzed using CyQUANT fluorescence
      binding assay and Boyden chamber respectively. RNA was extracted and RT-PCR and
      Northern blot analyses were performed using HGF, KGF, EGF and HGF-R primers and
      probes. RESULTS: Forty-eight hours after the wound, the uncovered area (in
      arbitrary units) for control corneas was (6.0 +/- 1.5) U. PAF dramatically
      inhibited corneal epithelial wound closure, and the uncovered area was (58.0 +/- 
      7.0) U. The PAF antagonist completely abolished the effect of PAF with values
      similar to controls (5.0 +/- 1.0) U. PAF significantly increased the cell
      adhesion among RCE cells, while at the concentration of 100 nmol/L, PAF had no
      effect on the proliferation and migration of RCE cells. RT-PCR results revealed
      that PAF at 100 nmol/L decreased the HGF mRNA expression 4.1 times in RCK and
      HGF-R 3.5 times in RCE at 24 h compared to control group, while PAF had no effect
      on the expression of KGF and EGF in RCE cells. Northern blot data confirmed these
      results. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that PAF causes significant delay of
      corneal epithelial wound healing. This effect may partially be due to the
      increased RCE cell adhesion and suppressed expression of HGF gene in RCK and
      HGF-R. The PAF antagonist BN can completely abolish the effect of PAF and enhance
      the corneal wound repair.

TI  - MicroRNAs act sequentially and asymmetrically to control chemosensory laterality 
      in the nematode.
PG  - 785-9
AB  - Animal microRNAs (miRNAs) are gene regulatory factors that prevent the expression
      of specific messenger RNA targets by binding to their 3' untranslated region. The
      Caenorhabditis elegans lsy-6 miRNA (for lateral symmetry defective) is required
      for the left/right asymmetric expression of guanyl cyclase (gcy) genes in two
      chemosensory neurons termed ASE left (ASEL) and ASE right (ASER). The asymmetric 
      expression of these putative chemoreceptors in turn correlates with the
      functional lateralization of the ASE neurons. Here we find that a mutation in the
      die-1 zinc-finger transcription factor disrupts both the chemosensory laterality 
      and left/right asymmetric expression of chemoreceptor genes in the ASE neurons.
      die-1 controls chemosensory laterality by activating the expression of lsy-6
      specifically in ASEL, but not in ASER, where die-1 expression is downregulated
      through two sites in its 3' untranslated region. These two sites are
      complementary to mir-273, a previously uncharacterized miRNA, whose expression is
      strongly biased towards ASER. Forced bilateral expression of mir-273 in ASEL and 
      ASER causes a loss of asymmetric die-1 expression and ASE laterality. Thus, an
      inverse distribution of two sequentially acting miRNAs in two bilaterally
      symmetric neurons controls laterality of the nematode chemosensory system.

TI  - One of the two Dicer-like proteins in the filamentous fungi Magnaporthe oryzae
      genome is responsible for hairpin RNA-triggered RNA silencing and related small
      interfering RNA accumulation.
PG  - 44467-74
AB  - Dicer is a ribonuclease III-like enzyme playing a key role in the RNA silencing
      pathway. Genome sequencing projects have demonstrated that eukaryotic genomes
      vary in the numbers of Dicer-like (DCL) proteins from one (human) to four
      (Arabidopsis). Two DCL genes, MDL-1 and -2 (Magnaporthe Dicer-like-1 and -2) have
      been identified in the genome of the filamentous fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Here 
      we show that the knockout of MDL-2 drastically impaired gene silencing of
      enhanced green fluorescence protein by hairpin RNA and reduced related small
      interfering RNA (siRNA) accumulation to nondetectable levels. In contrast,
      mutating the other DCL, MDL-1, exhibited a gene silencing frequency similar to
      wild type and accumulated siRNA normally. The silencing-deficient phenotype and
      loss of siRNA accumulation in the mdl-2 mutant was restored by genetic
      complementation with the wild-type MDL-2 allele. These results indicate that only
      MDL-2 is responsible for siRNA production, and no functional redundancy exists
      between MDL-1 and MDL-2 in the RNA silencing pathway in M. oryzae. Our findings
      contrast with a recent report in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, where 
      two DCL proteins are redundantly involved in the RNA silencing pathway, but are
      similar to the results obtained in a more distantly related organism, Drosophila 
      melanogaster, where an individual DCL protein has a distinct role in the
      siRNA/micro-RNA pathways.

      centrosome, as cell enters into anaphase. Here, we show that a centrosomal
      protein TACC2 is phosphorylated in mitosis by TTK signaling pathway. TACC2 was
      pulled down by wild type TTK but not kinase death mutant, suggesting the
      potential phosphorylation-mediated interaction between these two proteins. Our
      immunofluorescence studies revealed that both TTK and TACC2 are located to the
      centrosome. Interestingly, expression of kinase death mutant of TTK eliminated
      the centrosomal localization of TACC2 but not other centrosomal proteins such as 
      gamma-tubulin and NuMA, a phenotype seen in TTK-depleted cells. In these
      centrosomal TACC2-liberated cells, chromosomes were lagging and mis-aligned. In
      addition, the distance between two centrosomes was markedly reduced, suggesting
      that centrosomal TACC2 is required for mitotic spindle maintenance. The
      inter-relationship between TTK and TACC2 established here provides new avenue to 
      study centrosome and spindle dynamics underlying cell divisional control.

TI  - Sm proteins, the constituents of the spliceosome, are components of nuage and
      mitochondrial cement in Xenopus oocytes.
PG  - 171-8
AB  - A conserved feature of germ cells in many animal species is the presence of
      perinuclear electron-dense material called the "nuage" that is believed to be a
      precursor of germinal (or polar or P) granules. In Xenopus oogenesis the nuage is
      first observed near the nuclear envelope and subsequently in close contact with
      mitochondria, at which stage it is called the mitochondrial cement. In this
      study, we found that, in Xenopus pre-stage I and stage I oocytes, nuage and
      mitochondrial cement contain the spliceosomal Sm proteins, Xcat2 mRNA, and
      DEAD-box RNA helicase XVLG1. Other components of Cajal bodies or splicing
      machinery such as coilin, SMN protein, and snRNAs are absent from the nuage and
      mitochondrial cement. We suggest that Xenopus Sm proteins have adapted to a role 
      independent of pre-mRNA splicing and that instead of binding to their traditional
      spliceosomal partner such as snRNA, they bind mRNAs that are the components of
      germinal granules (i.e., Xcat2 mRNA) and facilitate the transport of these mRNAs 
      from the nucleus to the nuage that is a precursor of germinal granules. In
      addition, the presence of Vasa-like DEAD-box helicase in Xenopus nuage suggests
      involvement of nuage in the microRNA and/or RNAi pathway, similar to the role of 
      nuage in Drosophila.

TI  - EST analysis of mRNAs expressed during embryogenesis in Gallus gallus.
PG  - 333-7
AB  - Chicken Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) were analyzed to identify genes associated
      with myogenesis during embryonic development. A total of 6,184 ESTs were
      generated from three cDNA libraries constructed from whole embryos (Stage 26),
      somites associated with neural tube (Stage 15), and limb buds (Stages 21, 24 and 
      26). Clustering and assembly of 4,998 valid ESTs resulted in 2,329 unique
      sequences with 902 clusters (38.7%) and 1,427 singletons (61.3%). There are more 
      than 400,000 chicken ESTs available at GenBank and we were able to identify 143
      novel sequences. From these, 45 sequences found either a human EST homolog or a
      match with conserved regions among proteins. Most of these sequences were found
      to be expressed in somites, an important tissue for muscle development and not
      characterized before. This study revealed the value of micro dissected embryonic 
      libraries for describing gene expression profiles associated with myogenesis and 
      gene discovery.

TI  - Indometacin up-regulates TFF2 expression in gastric epithelial cells.
PG  - 171-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Trefoil factor family peptides are expressed in gastrointestinal
      epithelial cells and play a critical role in maintaining mucosal integrity.
      Although non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are important causative
      agents of gastric mucosal lesions, few data are available about the effect of
      NSAIDs on trefoil family peptides in gastric mucosa. AIM: To examine whether
      indometacin, a widely used NSAID, affects trefoil factor family expression in
      gastric epithelial cells. METHODS: MKN45, a cell line derived from human gastric 
      cancer, was used. TFF1, TFF2, and TFF3 mRNA expression was assessed by real-time 
      quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). TFF2 gene 
      transcription was also examined by luciferase reporter gene assay. RESULTS:
      Relative expression level of TFF1, TFF2, TFF3 mRNA was 616: 12: 1 in unstimulated
      MKN45 cells. Although indometacin (1-250 micro mol/L) had no significant effect
      on the expression of TFF1 and TFF3 mRNA, it up-regulated TFF2 mRNA expression in 
      a dose- and time-dependent manner. Luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed the
      up-regulation of TFF2 gene transcription by indometacin. Indometacin-induced
      up-regulation of TFF2 expression was not antagonized by externally applied
      prostaglandin E2. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that indometacin up-regulates
      gastric epithelial cell TFF2 expression through a COX-independent mechanism.
      Since TFF peptides play an important role in gastric mucosal protection,
      indometacin-induced TFF2 may reduce the degree of gastric mucosal damage induced 
      by indometacin.

TI  - Small interfering RNA-induced transcriptional gene silencing in human cells.
PG  - 1289-92
AB  - Small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA silence genes at the transcriptional, 
      posttranscriptional, and/or translational level. Using human tissue culture
      cells, we show that promoter-directed siRNA inhibits transcription of an
      integrated, proviral, elongation factor 1alpha (EF1A) promoter-green fluorescent 
      protein reporter gene and of endogenous EF1A. Silencing was associated with DNA
      methylation of the targeted sequence, and it required either active transport of 
      siRNA into the nucleus or permeabilization of the nuclear envelope by lentiviral 
      transduction. These results demonstrate that siRNA-directed transcriptional
      silencing is conserved in mammals, providing a means to inhibit mammalian gene
      function.

TI  - Combined disruption of both the MEK/ERK and the IL-6R/STAT3 pathways is required 
      to induce apoptosis of multiple myeloma cells in the presence of bone marrow
      stromal cells.
PG  - 3712-21
AB  - The interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R)/signal transducer and activator of
      transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway contributes to the pathogenesis of multiple
      myeloma (MM) and protects MM cells from apoptosis. However, MM cells survive the 
      IL-6R blockade if they are cocultured with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs),
      suggesting that the BM microenvironment stimulates IL-6-independent pathways that
      exert a pro-survival effect. The goal of this study was to investigate the
      underlying mechanism. Detailed pathway analysis revealed that BMSCs stimulate
      STAT3 via the IL-6R, and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases via
      IL-6R-independent mechanisms. Abolition of MEK1,2 activity with PD98059, or
      ERK1,2 small interfering RNA knockdown, was insufficient to induce apoptosis.
      However, the combined disruption of the IL-6R/STAT3 and MEK1,2/ERK1,2 pathways
      led to strong induction of apoptosis even in the presence of BMSCs. This effect
      was observed with MM cell lines and with primary MM cells, suggesting that the
      BMSC-induced activation of MEK1,2/ERK1,2 renders MM cells IL-6R/STAT3
      independent. Therefore, in the presence of cells from the BM micro-environment,
      combined targeting of different (and independently activated) pathways is
      required to efficiently induce apoptosis of MM cells. This might have direct
      implications for the development of future therapeutic strategies for MM.

TI  - MicroRNA regulation of the CUC genes is required for boundary size control in
      Arabidopsis meristems.
PG  - 4311-22
AB  - We have analysed the role of a microRNA, miR164, in boundary formation during
      organ initiation from Arabidopsis meristems. The establishment and maintenance of
      the boundary domain are controlled by three partially redundant genes, CUP-SHAPED
      COTYLEDON1 (CUC1), CUC2 and CUC3. We show that miR164 overexpression phenocopies 
      the cuc1 cuc2 double mutant by inducing post-transcriptional downregulation of
      CUC1 and CUC2 but not CUC3 mRNA levels. Disruption of CUC2 regulation by miR164, 
      either by making CUC2 resistant to the miRNA or by reducing miRNA levels leads to
      similar enlarged boundary domains. We relate this enlargement to the division
      patterns of the boundary cells. We propose that miR164 constrains the expansion
      of the boundary domain, by degrading CUC1 and CUC2 mRNAs.

TI  - Biodegradation of chloromethane by Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain NB1 under
      nitrate-reducing and aerobic conditions.
PG  - 4629-34
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain NB1 uses chloromethane (CM) as its sole source of
      carbon and energy under nitrate-reducing and aerobic conditions. The observed
      yield of NB1 was 0.20 (+/-0.06) (mean +/- standard deviation) and 0.28 (+/-0.01) 
      mg of total suspended solids (TSS) mg of CM(-1) under anoxic and aerobic
      conditions, respectively. The stoichiometry of nitrate consumption was 0.75
      (+/-0.10) electron equivalents (eeq) of NO(3)(-) per eeq of CM, which is
      consistent with the yield when it is expressed on an eeq basis. Nitrate was
      stoichiometrically converted to dinitrogen (0.51 +/- 0.05 mol of N(2) per mol of 
      NO(3)(-)). The stoichiometry of oxygen use with CM (0.85 +/- 0.21 eeq of O(2) per
      eeq of CM) was also consistent with the aerobic yield. Stoichiometric release of 
      chloride and minimal accumulation of soluble metabolic products (measured as
      chemical oxygen demand) following CM consumption, under anoxic and aerobic
      conditions, indicated complete biodegradation of CM. Acetylene did not inhibit CM
      use under aerobic conditions, implying that a monooxygenase was not involved in
      initiating aerobic CM metabolism. Under anoxic conditions, the maximum specific
      CM utilization rate (k) for NB1 was 5.01 (+/-0.06) micromol of CM mg of TSS(-1)
      day(-1), the maximum specific growth rate (micro(max)) was 0.0506 day(-1), and
      the Monod half-saturation coefficient (K(s)) was 0.067 (+/-0.004) microM. Under
      aerobic conditions, the values for k, micro(max), and K(s) were 10.7 (+/-0.11)
      micromol of CM mg of TSS(-1) day(-1), 0.145 day(-1), and 0.93 (+/-0.042) microM, 
      respectively, indicating that NB1 used CM faster under aerobic conditions. Strain
      NB1 also grew on methanol, ethanol, and acetate under denitrifying and aerobic
      conditions, but not on methane, formate, or dichloromethane.

TI  - The B chromosomes in Brachycome.
PG  - 199-209
AB  - This review presents a historical account of studies of B chromosomes in the
      genus Brachycome Cass. (synonym: Brachyscome) from the earliest cytological
      investigations carried out in the late 1960s though to the most recent molecular 
      analyses. Molecular analyses provide insights into the origin and evolution of
      the B chromosomes (Bs) of Brachycome dichromosomatica, a species which has Bs of 
      two different sizes. The larger Bs are somatically stable whereas the smaller, or
      micro, Bs are somatically unstable. Both B types contain clusters of ribosomal
      RNA genes that have been shown unequivocally to be inactive in the case of the
      larger Bs. The large Bs carry a family of tandem repeat sequences (Bd49) that are
      located mainly at the centromere. Multiple copies of sequences related to this
      repeat are present on the A chromosomes (As) of related species, whereas only a
      few copies exist in the A chromosomes of B. dichromosomatica. The micro Bs share 
      DNA sequences with the As and the larger Bs, and they also have B-specific
      repeats (Bdm29 and Bdm54). In some cases repeat sequences on the micro Bs have
      been shown to occur as clusters on the A chromosomes in a proportion of
      individuals within a population. It is clear that none of these B types
      originated by simple excision of segments from the A chromosomes.

TI  - Structural features of microRNA (miRNA) precursors and their relevance to miRNA
      biogenesis and small interfering RNA/short hairpin RNA design.
PG  - 42230-9
AB  - We have established the structures of 10 human microRNA (miRNA) precursors using 
      biochemical methods. Eight of these structures turned out to be different from
      those that were computer-predicted. The differences localized in the terminal
      loop region and at the opposite side of the precursor hairpin stem. We have
      analyzed the features of these structures from the perspectives of miRNA
      biogenesis and active strand selection. We demonstrated the different
      thermodynamic stability profiles for pre-miRNA hairpins harboring miRNAs at their
      5'- and 3'-sides and discussed their functional implications. Our results showed 
      that miRNA prediction based on predicted precursor structures may give ambiguous 
      results, and the success rate is significantly higher for the experimentally
      determined structures. On the other hand, the differences between the predicted
      and experimentally determined structures did not affect the stability of termini 
      produced through "conceptual dicing." This result confirms the value of
      thermodynamic analysis based on mfold as a predictor of strand section by
      RNAi-induced silencing complex (RISC).

TI  - Expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 in penile tissue from rats with
      bilateral cavernosal nerve ablation.
PG  - 424-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the expression of transforming growth factor-beta(1)
      (TGF-beta1) in penile tissue from rats after bilateral cavernosal nerve (CN)
      ablation, mimicking patients who have had no nerve-sparing during prostatectomy. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten adult male rats (neurectomy group) had a bilateral CN 
      resection aseptically under an operating microscope, with six sham-operated rats 
      as controls. Fifteen weeks after surgery an apomorphine test was used in all rats
      to assess penile erection. The penile specimens were then collected and prepared 
      for detecting the expression of TGF-beta1 by reverse transcription-polymerase
      chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blot and immunohistochemistry, and for
      quantitative analysis of the ratio of smooth muscle to collagen fibres in the
      corpus cavernosum with confocal microscopy. RESULTS: All rats in the
      sham-operated group but none after neurectomy had an erectile response after
      subcutaneous injection with apomorphine (100 micro g/kg). Immunohistochemistry,
      RT-PCR and western blot analyses showed a significantly higher expression of
      TGF-beta1 in the penile tissues after neurectomy than after sham surgery. Smooth 
      muscle cells (fluorescing red) and collagen fibres (green autofluorescence) after
      paraformaldehyde fixation, were clearly identified by confocal microscopy. The
      fluorescence intensity expressed as the mean (sem) ratio of smooth muscle to
      collagen fibres in the corpus cavernosum after neurectomy was 0.265 (0.125),
      significantly lower than that in the sham-operated group, at 0.760 (0.196) (P <
      0.01). CONCLUSION: An increased expression of TGF-beta1 in penile tissue which
      promotes the synthesis of collagen may be one of the important factors for the
      erectile dysfunction caused by bilateral CN ablation. Similar pathophysiological 
      processes may occur in the corpus cavernosum of patients after radical
      prostatectomy.

TI  - The long hand of the small RNAs reaches into several levels of gene regulation.
PG  - 472-81
AB  - Small RNA molecules such as siRNAs and miRNAs represent a new class of molecules 
      that have been implicated in a wide range of diverse gene silencing phenomena. It
      is now becoming clear that these two similar molecules share several common
      features in both their biogenesis and their mechanism of action. Thus, the siRNA 
      and miRNA pathways may have evolved from a common ancestral mechanism that has
      diverged to play important roles in developmental regulation, genomic
      organisation, and cellular defence against foreign nucleic acids.

TI  - Argonaute2 is the catalytic engine of mammalian RNAi.
PG  - 1437-41
AB  - Gene silencing through RNA interference (RNAi) is carried out by RISC, the
      RNA-induced silencing complex. RISC contains two signature components, small
      interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and Argonaute family proteins. Here, we show that the
      multiple Argonaute proteins present in mammals are both biologically and
      biochemically distinct, with a single mammalian family member, Argonaute2, being 
      responsible for messenger RNA cleavage activity. This protein is essential for
      mouse development, and cells lacking Argonaute2 are unable to mount an
      experimental response to siRNAs. Mutations within a cryptic ribonuclease H domain
      within Argonaute2, as identified by comparison with the structure of an archeal
      Argonaute protein, inactivate RISC. Thus, our evidence supports a model in which 
      Argonaute contributes "Slicer" activity to RISC, providing the catalytic engine
      for RNAi.

TI  - MicroRNA profiling reveals distinct signatures in B cell chronic lymphocytic
      leukemias.
PG  - 11755-60
AB  - Little is known about the expression levels or function of micro-RNAs (miRNAs) in
      normal and neoplastic cells, although it is becoming clear that miRNAs play
      important roles in the regulation of gene expression during development [Ambros, 
      V. (2003) Cell 113, 673-676; McManus, M. T. (2003) Semin. Cancer Biol. 13,
      253-258]. We now report the genomewide expression profiling of miRNAs in human B 
      cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) by using a microarray containing hundreds
      of human precursor and mature miRNA oligonucleotide probes. This approach allowed
      us to identify significant differences in miRNome expression between CLL samples 
      and normal CD5+ B cells; data were confirmed by Northern blot analyses and
      real-time RT-PCR. At least two distinct clusters of CLL samples can be identified
      that were associated with the presence or absence of Zap-70 expression, a
      predictor of early disease progression. Two miRNA signatures were associated with
      the presence or absence of mutations in the expressed Ig variableregion genes or 
      with deletions at 13q14, respectively. These data suggest that miRNA expression
      patterns have relevance to the biological and clinical behavior of this leukemia.

TI  - MicroRNA control of PHABULOSA in leaf development: importance of pairing to the
      microRNA 5' region.
PG  - 3356-64
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 22-nucleotide noncoding RNAs that can
      regulate gene expression by directing mRNA degradation or inhibiting productive
      translation. Dominant mutations in PHABULOSA (PHB) and PHAVOLUTA (PHV) map to a
      miR165/166 complementary site and impair miRNA-guided cleavage of these mRNAs in 
      vitro. Here, we confirm that disrupted miRNA pairing, not changes in PHB protein 
      sequence, causes the developmental defects in phb-d mutants. In planta,
      disrupting miRNA pairing near the center of the miRNA complementary site had far 
      milder developmental consequences than more distal mismatches. These differences 
      correlated with differences in miRNA-directed cleavage efficiency in vitro, where
      mismatch scanning revealed more tolerance for mismatches at the center and 3' end
      of the miRNA compared to mismatches to the miRNA 5' region. In this respect,
      miR165/166 resembles animal miRNAs in its pairing requirements. Pairing to the 5'
      portion of the small silencing RNA appears crucial regardless of the mode of
      post-transcriptional repression or whether it occurs in plants or animals,
      supporting a model in which this region of the silencing RNA nucleates pairing to
      its target.

TI  - Expression of glucocorticoid receptors alpha and beta in steroid sensitive and
      steroid insensitive interstitial lung diseases.
PG  - 687-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sensitivity to glucocorticoids may be related to the concentration of
      glucocorticoid receptors alpha (GRalpha) and beta (GRbeta). A study was
      undertaken to assess GRalpha and GRbeta expression in steroid insensitive
      interstitial lung disease (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)) and steroid
      sensitive interstitial lung diseases (sarcoidosis and cryptogenic organising
      pneumonia (COP)). METHODS: Lung tissue was obtained from control subjects and
      from patients with IPF, sarcoidosis, and COP. Pulmonary function tests were
      carried out at the time of lung biopsy and every 3 months. GRalpha and GRbeta
      expression was evaluated by both competitive RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry.
      Data are presented as median and 25-75th percentile. RESULTS: GRalpha mRNA
      expression (10(5) cDNA copies/ micro g total RNA) was higher in patients with
      steroid sensitive interstitial lung diseases (10.0; 7.8-14.9; n = 11) than in
      patients with IPF (4.4; 3.2-6.6; n = 19; p<0.001). GRbeta expression was at least
      1000 times lower than that of GRalpha and did not differ between the three
      groups. A negative correlation was found between GRalpha mRNA levels and the
      fibrotic pathology score of the tissue (r = -0.484, p<0.01) and a positive
      correlation was found between GRalpha mRNA levels and improvement in forced vital
      capacity (r = 0.633; p<0.01) after treatment of patients with glucocorticoids.
      Immunoreactivity for GR protein was also higher in patients with sarcoidosis and 
      COP than in those with IPF. CONCLUSION: The variable response of some
      interstitial lung diseases to steroid treatment may be the result of differences 
      in the expression of GRalpha.

TI  - Divergence of conserved non-coding sequences: rate estimates and relative rate
      tests.
PG  - 2116-21
AB  - In many eukaryotic genomes only a small fraction of the DNA codes for proteins,
      but the non-protein coding DNA harbors important genetic elements directing the
      development and the physiology of the organisms, like promoters, enhancers,
      insulators, and micro-RNA genes. The molecular evolution of these genetic
      elements is difficult to study because their functional significance is hard to
      deduce from sequence information alone. Here we propose an approach to the study 
      of the rate of evolution of functional non-coding sequences at a
      macro-evolutionary scale. We identify functionally important non-coding sequences
      as Conserved Non-Coding Nucleotide (CNCN) sequences from the comparison of two
      outgroup species. The CNCN sequences so identified are then compared to their
      homologous sequences in a pair of ingroup species, and we monitor the degree of
      modification these sequences suffered in the two ingroup lineages. We propose a
      method to test for rate differences in the modification of CNCN sequences among
      the two ingroup lineages, as well as a method to estimate their rate of
      modification. We apply this method to the full sequences of the HoxA clusters
      from six gnathostome species: a shark, Heterodontus francisci; a basal ray finned
      fish, Polypterus senegalus; the amphibian, Xenopus tropicalis; as well as three
      mammalian species, human, rat and mouse. The results show that the evolutionary
      rate of CNCN sequences is not distinguishable among the three mammalian lineages,
      while the Xenopus lineage has a significantly increased rate of evolution.
      Furthermore the estimates of the rate parameters suggest that in the stem lineage
      of mammals the rate of CNCN sequence evolution was more than twice the rate
      observed within the placental amniotes clade, suggesting a high rate of evolution
      of cis-regulatory elements during the origin of amniotes and mammals. We conclude
      that the proposed methods can be used for testing hypotheses about the rate and
      pattern of evolution of putative cis-regulatory elements.

TI  - The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase homologue is differentially
      regulated in phases of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis: molecular and phylogenetic 
      analysis.
PG  - 667-75
AB  - Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) plays important roles in various
      cellular processes. Here we report the sequence and analysis of a novel
      developmentally regulated gene and cDNA (Pbgadph), encoding a GAPDH homologue
      (PbGAPDH), of the pathogenic dimorphic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. We
      have analyzed the protein, the cDNA and genomic sequences to provide insights
      into the structure, function, and potential regulation of PbGAPDH. That Pbgapdh
      encodes PbGAPDH was demonstrated by micro-sequencing of the native protein
      homologue isolated from the fungus proteome. The deduced amino acid sequence of
      Pbgapdh showed identity to those of from other species (88-76%). Phylogenetic
      analysis indicated that GAPDH could be useful for the determination of
      evolutionary relationships. Expression of the Pbgapdh gene and the cognate
      protein were developmentally regulated in phases of P. brasiliensis, with a
      higher expression in the yeast parasitic phase and was induced during the
      transition from mycelium to yeast and decreased during the reverse process,
      transition from yeast to mycelium.

TI  - Loss of viral control in early HIV-1 infection is temporally associated with
      sequential escape from CD8+ T cell responses and decrease in HIV-1-specific CD4+ 
      and CD8+ T cell frequencies.
PG  - 713-21
AB  - The outcome of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is related
      to the set-point plasma virus load (pVL) that emerges after primary HIV-1
      infection (PHI). This set-point pVL generally remains stable but eventually
      increases with progression to disease. However, the events leading to loss of
      viremic control are poorly understood. Here, we describe an individual who
      presented with symptomatic PHI and subsequently progressed rapidly, after an
      initial period of 1 year during which viral replication was well controlled.
      Escalation of viral replication in this atypical case was preceded by the
      emergence of escape variants in many epitopes targeted by dominant CD8+ T cell
      responses and a marked decrease in HIV-1-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell
      frequencies. There were no changes in viral tropism, replication kinetics, or
      neutralizing antibody titers. These findings demonstrate the temporal
      relationship between viral escape from CD8+ T cell activity, decrease in
      HIV-1-specific T cell frequencies, and loss of control of viral replication.

TI  - RNA editing of a miRNA precursor.
PG  - 1174-7
AB  - Micro RNAs comprise a large family of small, functional RNAs with important roles
      in the regulation of protein coding genes in animals and plants. Here we show
      that human and mouse miRNA22 precursor molecules are subject to
      posttranscriptional modification by A-to-I RNA editing in vivo. The observed
      editing events are predicted to have significant implications for the biogenesis 
      and function of miRNA22 and might point toward a more general role for RNA
      editing in the regulation of miRNA gene expression.

TI  - Detection of 91 potential conserved plant microRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana and
      Oryza sativa identifies important target genes.
PG  - 11511-6
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an extensive class of tiny RNA molecules that regulate the
      expression of target genes by means of complementary base pair interactions.
      Although the first miRNAs were discovered in Caenorhabditis elegans, >300 miRNAs 
      were recently documented in animals and plants, both by cloning methods and
      computational predictions. We present a genome-wide computational approach to
      detect miRNA genes in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. Our method is based on the
      conservation of short sequences between the genomes of Arabidopsis and rice
      (Oryza sativa) and on properties of the secondary structure of the miRNA
      precursor. The method was fine-tuned to take into account plant-specific
      properties, such as the variable length of the miRNA precursor sequences. In
      total, 91 potential miRNA genes were identified, of which 58 had at least one
      nearly perfect match with an Arabidopsis mRNA, constituting the potential targets
      of those miRNAs. In addition to already known transcription factors involved in
      plant development, the targets also comprised genes involved in several other
      cellular processes, such as sulfur assimilation and ubiquitin-dependent protein
      degradation. These findings considerably broaden the scope of miRNA functions in 
      plants.

TI  - RNA interference of IL-10 in leukemic B-1 cells.
PG  - 6
AB  - RNA interference, or RNAi, is designed to work by Watson-Crick base pairing and
      to result in a posttranscriptional block in protein synthesis. Antiapoptotic
      proteins are a major focus of cancer therapy and make attractive targets for
      RNAi. An IL-10 RNAi sequence was designed in accordance with Tuschl rules and was
      modeled to a hairpin configuration. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the
      most common leukemia in the Western world, the failure to undergo apoptosis may
      be responsible for the accumulation of malignant B-1 cells. Interleukin-10,
      despite controversy, has been shown to have antiapoptotic properties, and
      increased endogenous IL-10 production has been found in CLL by several labs. A
      malignant B-1 cell line, LNC, derived from an NZB mouse (a murine model for CLL) 
      was utilized as a target for IL-10 RNAi. Our earlier studies of antisense IL-10
      resulted in antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects. The cytotoxic effects of 
      IL-10 RNAi were dose- and time-dependent, with an optimal dose 10-fold lower than
      that of antisense IL-10. IL-10 RNAi lowered IL-10 protein as measured by ELISA. 2
      micro M IL-10 RNAi initiated a G2/M block and a decrease in the message for
      cdc25C, the M-phase inducer phosphatase. IL-10 RNAi efficiently induced
      apoptosis. Bcl7C, a member of the antiapoptotic Bcl family, was significantly
      down-regulated. IL-10 modulating Bcl7C expression represents a novel mechanism in
      the evasion of apoptosis. This approach, by itself or in conjunction with current
      therapies, merits consideration in similar B-cell malignancies.

TI  - Intravenous, non-viral RNAi gene therapy of brain cancer.
PG  - 1103-13
AB  - RNA interference (RNAi) has the potential to knock down oncogenes in cancer,
      including brain cancer. However, the therapeutic potential of RNAi will not be
      realised until the rate-limiting step of delivery is solved. The development of
      RNA-based therapeutics is not practical, due to the instability of RNA in vivo.
      However, plasmid DNA can be engineered to express short hairpin RNA (shRNA),
      similar to endogenous microRNAs. Intravenous, non-viral RNAi-based gene therapy
      is enabled with a new gene-targeting technology, which encapsulates the plasmid
      DNA inside receptor-specific pegylated immunoliposomes (PILs). The feasibility of
      this RNAi approach was evaluated by showing it was possible to achieve a 90%
      knockdown of brain tumour-specific gene expression with a single intravenous
      injection in adult rats or mice with intracranial brain cancer. The survival of
      mice with intracranial human brain cancer was extended by nearly 90% with weekly 
      intravenous injections of PILs carrying plasmid DNA expressing a shRNA directed
      against the human epidermal growth factor receptor. RNAi-based gene therapy can
      be coupled with gene therapy that replaces mutated tumour suppressor genes to
      build a polygenic approach to the gene therapy of cancer.

TI  - In vitro induction of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9
      expression in keratinocytes by boron and manganese.
PG  - 484-90
AB  - Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 are involved in keratinocyte migration
      and granulation tissue remodeling during wound healing. Thermal water cures are
      sometimes proposed as complementary treatment for accelerating healing of wounds 
      resulting from burns and/or surgery, but their mechanisms of action remain
      unknown. Some thermal waters are rich in trace elements such as boron and
      manganese. Interestingly, clinical studies have shown the beneficial effects of
      trace elements such as boron and manganese for human wound healing. To try to
      specify the role of trace elements in cutaneous healing, the present study
      investigated the effects of these trace elements on the production of MMP-2 and
      MMP-9 by normal human keratinocytes cultured in vitro. Immunohistochemistry and
      Western blot showed that intracellular MMP-9 expression in keratinocytes was
      induced when incubated for 6 h with boron at 10 micro g/ml or manganese at 0.2
      micro g/ml. Moreover, gelatin zymography on keratinocyte supernatants showed an
      increase of gelatinase secretion after 24 h of incubation of keratinocytes with
      boron or manganese, regardless of concentration. Gelatinase secretion was not
      associated with keratinocyte proliferation induced by trace elements. Thus, our
      results suggest that boron and manganese could play a role in the clinical
      efficiency of thermal water on wound healing.

TI  - Human Argonaute2 mediates RNA cleavage targeted by miRNAs and siRNAs.
PG  - 185-97
AB  - Argonaute proteins associate with small RNAs that guide mRNA degradation,
      translational repression, or a combination of both. The human Argonaute family
      has eight members, four of which (Ago1 through Ago4) are closely related and
      coexpressed in many cell types. To understand the biological function of the
      different Ago proteins, we set out to determine if Ago1 through Ago4 are
      associated with miRNAs as well as RISC activity in human cell lines. Our results 
      suggest that miRNAs are incorporated indiscriminately of their sequence into Ago1
      through Ago4 containing microRNPs (miRNPs). Purification of the
      FLAG/HA-epitope-tagged Ago containing complexes from different human cell lines
      revealed that endonuclease activity is exclusively associated with Ago2.
      Exogenously introduced siRNAs also associate with Ago2 for guiding target RNA
      cleavage. The specific role of Ago2 in guiding target RNA cleavage was confirmed 
      independently by siRNA-based depletion of individual Ago members in combination
      with a sensitive positive-readout reporter assay.

TI  - AtXRN4 degrades mRNA in Arabidopsis and its substrates include selected miRNA
      targets.
PG  - 173-83
AB  - Messenger RNA degradation is an essential step in gene expression that can be
      regulated by siRNAs or miRNAs. However, most of our knowledge of in vivo
      eukaryotic mRNA degradation mechanisms derives from Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
      which lacks miRNAs and RNAi capability. Using reverse genetic and microarray
      analyses, we have identified multiple substrates of AtXRN4, the Arabidopsis
      homolog of the major yeast mRNA degrading exoribonuclease, Xrn1p. Insertional
      mutation of AtXRN4 leads to accumulation of the 3' end of several mRNAs, in a
      manner that correlates with increased stability of the 3' end, and is reversed
      following complementation with AtXRN4. Moreover, 3' products of miRNA-mediated
      cleavage of SCARECROW-LIKE transcripts and several other miRNA target transcripts
      are among those that accumulate in xrn4 mutants. The demonstration that an Xrn1p 
      homolog degrades mRNA in a multicellular eukaryote and contributes to the
      miRNA-mediated decay pathway of selected targets has implications for XRNs in
      other organisms.

PG  - 102-6
AB  - The etiology of idiopathic cranial nerve palsies often remains unresolved. It has
      been hypothesised that viral reactivation of herpesviruses in the corresponding
      nuclei in the brainstem is the cause. We investigated the distribution of herpes 
      simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) in nuclei that are 
      associated with peripheral sensory ganglia [oculomotor (nIII), facial (nVII)
      nuclei] and in nuclei that are not associated with peripheral sensory ganglia
      [trochlear (nIV), abducens (nVI), and hypoglossal (nXII) nuclei] of five human
      brainstems. Samples of the cranial nerve nuclei and adjacent control tissue were 
      taken from histological sections after precise identification of every single
      nucleus and control tissue. DNA and RNA amplification methods were used to
      determine the prevalence and distribution of HSV-1 and VZV. The distribution of
      human herpes virus type 6 (HHV-6) was also determined and served as a control,
      since HHV-6 infection has never been associated with idiopathic cranial nerve
      palsies. HSV-1 was distributed at random in all cranial nerve nuclei and control 
      tissue, whereas VZV DNA was not detected in any of the samples examined.
      Surprisingly, HHV-6 was present in almost all samples where HSV-1 was also
      present, however, the latency associated transcript (LAT) of HSV-1 was not found 
      in any of the samples positive for HSV-1 DNA. The absence of LAT in the samples
      positive for HSV-1 and the distribution of HSV-1 and HHV-6 do not support the
      hypothesis that idiopathic cranial nerve palsies result from viral reactivation
      in the brainstem nuclei.

TI  - A systemic small RNA signaling system in plants.
PG  - 1979-2000
AB  - Systemic translocation of RNA exerts non-cell-autonomous control over plant
      development and defense. Long-distance delivery of mRNA has been proven, but
      transport of small interfering RNA and microRNA remains to be demonstrated.
      Analyses performed on phloem sap collected from a range of plants identified
      populations of small RNA species. The dynamic nature of this population was
      reflected in its response to growth conditions and viral infection. The
      authenticity of these phloem small RNA molecules was confirmed by bioinformatic
      analysis; potential targets for a set of phloem small RNA species were
      identified. Heterografting studies, using spontaneously silencing coat protein
      (CP) plant lines, also established that transgene-derived siRNA move in the
      long-distance phloem and initiate CP gene silencing in the scion. Biochemical
      analysis of pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima) phloem sap led to the characterization of 
      C. maxima Phloem SMALL RNA BINDING PROTEIN1 (CmPSRP1), a unique component of the 
      protein machinery probably involved in small RNA trafficking. Equivalently sized 
      small RNA binding proteins were detected in phloem sap from cucumber (Cucumis
      sativus) and lupin (Lupinus albus). PSRP1 binds selectively to 25-nucleotide
      single-stranded RNA species. Microinjection studies provided direct evidence that
      PSRP1 could mediate the cell-to-cell trafficking of 25-nucleotide
      single-stranded, but not double-stranded, RNA molecules. The potential role
      played by PSRP1 in long-distance transmission of silencing signals is discussed
      with respect to the pathways and mechanisms used by plants to exert systemic
      control over developmental and physiological processes.

TI  - Novel and stress-regulated microRNAs and other small RNAs from Arabidopsis.
PG  - 2001-19
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs
      that have recently emerged as important regulators of mRNA degradation,
      translational repression, and chromatin modification. In Arabidopsis thaliana, 43
      miRNAs comprising 15 families have been reported thus far. In an attempt to
      identify novel and abiotic stress regulated miRNAs and siRNAs, we constructed a
      library of small RNAs from Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to dehydration,
      salinity, or cold stress or to the plant stress hormone abscisic acid. Sequencing
      of the library and subsequent analysis revealed 26 new miRNAs from 34 loci,
      forming 15 new families. Two of the new miRNAs from three loci are members of
      previously reported miR171 and miR319 families. Some of the miRNAs are
      preferentially expressed in specific tissues, and several are either upregulated 
      or downregulated by abiotic stresses. Ten of the miRNAs are highly conserved in
      other plant species. Fifty-one potential targets with diverse function were
      predicted for the newly identified miRNAs based on sequence complementarity. In
      addition to miRNAs, we identified 102 other novel endogenous small RNAs in
      Arabidopsis. These findings suggest that a large number of miRNAs and other small
      regulatory RNAs are encoded by the Arabidopsis genome and that some of them may
      play important roles in plant responses to environmental stresses as well as in
      development and genome maintenance.

TI  - Symbionts of the gut flagellate Staurojoenina sp. from Neotermes cubanus
      represent a novel, termite-associated lineage of Bacteroidales: description of
      'Candidatus Vestibaculum illigatum'.
PG  - 2229-35
AB  - The symbioses between cellulose-degrading flagellates and bacteria are one of the
      most fascinating phenomena in the complex micro-ecosystem found in the hindgut of
      lower termites. However, little is known about the identity of the symbionts. One
      example is the epibiotic bacteria colonizing the surface of hypermastigote
      protists of the genus Staurojoenina. By using scanning electron microscopy, it
      was shown that the whole surface of Staurojoenina sp. from the termite Neotermes 
      cubanus is densely covered with long rod-shaped bacteria of uniform size and
      morphology. PCR amplification of 16S rRNA genes from isolated protozoa and
      subsequent cloning yielded a uniform collection of clones with virtually
      identical sequences. Phylogenetic analysis placed them as a new lineage among the
      Bacteroidales, only distantly related to other uncultivated bacteria in the
      hindgut of other termites, including an epibiont of the flagellate Mixotricha
      paradoxa. The closest cultivated relative was Tannerella forsythensis (<85 %
      sequence identity). Fluorescence in situ hybridization with a newly designed
      clone-specific oligonucleotide probe confirmed that these sequences belong to the
      rod-shaped epibionts of Staurojoenina sp. Transmission electron microscopy
      confirmed the presence of a Gram-negative cell wall and revealed special
      attachment sites for the symbionts on the cell envelope of the flagellate host.
      Based on the isolated phylogenetic position and the specific association with the
      surface of Staurojoenina sp., we propose to classify this new taxon of
      Bacteroidales under the provisional name 'Candidatus Vestibaculum illigatum'.

TI  - [Imbalanced T cell-specific transcription factors T-bet and GATA-3 contributes to
      type 2 T helper cell polarization in asthmatic patients].
PG  - 398-402
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the T helper cell predominant differentiation in asthmatic
      patients and to explore the modulation of T cell-specific transcription factors
      T-bet/GATA-3. METHODS: Thirty-two asthmatic patients were enrolled, among whom 18
      were atopic defined by positive antigen skin test and 12 were children.
      Lymphocytes were isolated from peripheral blood and incubated with PHA (100
      microg/ml) at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. INF-gamma and IL-4 concentrations in the
      supernatant were detected by ELISA. The T-bet and GATA-3 mRNA expression levels
      in lymphocytes were assayed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
      (RT-PCR) while the ratio of CCR3+ and CCR5+ cells in lymphocytes was counted by
      flow cytometry (FCM) after direct immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: IL-4
      concentration in the lymphocyte supernatant of the asthmatic group was (118 +/-
      25) microg/L, which was significantly elevated compared to that of the healthy
      control group (75 +/- 12) microg/L (P < 0.01). When subgroups of asthmatic
      patients were compared, the results showed that atopic subjects had a higher IL-4
      level than non-atopic subjects [(126 +/- 23) microg/L vs (107 +/- 26) microg/L, P
      < 0.01], but no significant difference was demonstrated between adults and
      children [(118 +/- 25) micro g/L vs (121 +/- 25) microg/L, P > 0.05].
      Significantly lower concentration of INF-gamma in the asthmatic group was
      detected as compared to the control [(651 +/- 85) microg/L vs (1 179 +/- 332)
      microg/L, P < 0.001]. The concentration of INF-gamma was higher in atopic
      subjects than in non-atopic subjects [(618 +/- 89) micro g/L vs (680 +/- 83)
      microg/L, P < 0.01], but no difference was found between adults and children. The
      percentage of CCR3+ cells in lymphocytes was (9.4 +/- 5.8)% in the asthmatic
      group and (4.9 +/- 2.3)% in the control (P < 0.05), while the percentages of
      CCR5+ cells was (6 +/- 7)% and (13 +/- 7)%, respectively (P < 0.05). RT-PCR
      revealed that T-bet mRNA expression levels were as follows: 0.13 +/- 0.03 in the 
      asthmatic group and 0.18 +/- 0.04 in the control (P < 0.01); 0.120 +/- 0.030 in
      atopic subjects and 0.140 +/- 0.010 in the non-atopic subjects (P < 0.05); 0.120 
      +/- 0.020 in children and 0.130 +/- 0.020 in adults (P > 0.05). The levels of
      GATA-3 mRNA expression were 0.43 +/- 0.07 in asthma and 0.29 +/- 0.09 in the
      control (P < 0.01), however, no differences were found between atopic and
      non-atopic, children and adults (0.50 +/- 0.12 vs 0.40 +/- 0.10, 0.44 +/- 0.09 vs
      0.43 +/- 0.07, respectively, P > 0.05). A positive correlation was found between 
      concentration of INF-gamma and T-bet mRNA level (r=0.663, P < 0.01), while no
      correlation with GATA-3 mRNA expression was found. The concentration of IL-4 was 
      negatively correlated with T-bet mRNA level (r=-0.250, P < 0.05) and positively
      with GATA-3 mRNA level (r=0.72, P < 0.01). It was interesting that a closer
      relationship existed between the ratio of T-bet to GATA-3 and the ratio of
      INF-gamma to IL-4 (r=0.873, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In asthma there is a tendency
      of Th2 polarization with over-production of Th2-like cytokines in which T-bet
      deficiency may be a key factor. T-bet might direct T cells to Th1 differentiation
      while GATA-3 orientated Th2 maturation. Considering the fact that committed Th2
      cells underwent re-differentiation induced by T-bet, this novel Th1-specific
      transcription factor is a fascinating target gene for modifying to restore the
      Th1 and Th2 balance.

TI  - RNAi: running interference for the cell.
PG  - 1957-61
AB  - RNA interference or RNAi is a recently characterized mechanism of eukaryotic gene
      regulation in which a short sequence of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) specifically 
      down-regulates expression of the associated gene. Preliminary characterization of
      this phenomenon has revealed a set of inter-related cellular pathways which
      appear to represent both a response to foreign RNA and a mechanism of endogenous 
      gene regulation. Introduction of dsRNA into cells by a variety of means,
      including transfection of synthetic RNA duplexes, triggers the RNAi response
      resulting in specific suppression of target gene expression. Recent efforts on a 
      genome wide scale have involved application of RNAi as an important new tool in
      cell biology to elucidate gene function in living cells.

TI  - Dissection of a natural RNA silencing process in the Drosophila melanogaster germ
      line.
PG  - 6742-50
AB  - To date, few natural cases of RNA-silencing-mediated regulation have been
      described. Here, we analyzed repression of testis-expressed Stellate genes by the
      homologous Suppressors of Stellate [Su(Ste)] repeats that produce sense and
      antisense short RNAs. The Stellate promoter is dispensable for suppression, but
      local disturbance of complementarity between the Stellate transcript and the
      Su(Ste) repeats impairs silencing. Using in situ RNA hybridization, we found
      temporal control of the expression and spatial distribution of sense and
      antisense Stellate and Su(Ste) transcripts in germinal cells. Antisense Su(Ste)
      transcripts accumulate in the nuclei of early spermatocytes before the appearance
      of sense transcripts. The sense and antisense transcripts are colocalized in the 
      nuclei of mature spermatocytes, placing the initial step of silencing in the
      nucleus and suggesting formation of double-stranded RNA. Mutations in the
      aubergine and spindle-E genes, members of the Argonaute and RNA helicase gene
      families, respectively, impair silencing by eliminating the short Su(Ste) RNA,
      but have no effect on microRNA production. Thus, different small RNA-containing
      complexes operate in the male germ line.

TI  - Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of JAZ, a new cargo protein for exportin-5.
PG  - 6608-19
AB  - Exportin-5 is a nuclear export receptor for certain classes of double-stranded
      RNA (dsRNA), including pre-micro-RNAs, viral hairpin RNAs, and some tRNAs. It can
      also export the RNA binding proteins ILF3 and elongation factor EF1A. However,
      the rules that determine which RNA binding proteins are exportin-5 cargoes remain
      unclear. JAZ possesses an unusual dsRNA binding domain consisting of multiple
      C2H2 zinc fingers. We found that JAZ binds to exportin-5 in a Ran-GTP- and
      dsRNA-dependent manner. Exportin-5 stimulates JAZ shuttling, and gene silencing
      of exportin-5 reduces shuttling. Recombinant exportin-5 also stimulates nuclear
      export of JAZ in permeabilized cells. JAZ also binds to ILF3, and surprisingly,
      this interaction is RNA independent, even though it requires the dsRNA binding
      domains of ILF3. Exportin-5, JAZ, and ILF3 can form a heteromeric complex with
      Ran-GTP and dsRNA, and JAZ increases ILF3 binding to exportin-5. JAZ does not
      contain a classical nuclear localization signal, and in digitonin-permeabilized
      cells, nuclear accumulation of JAZ does not require energy or cytosol.
      Nonetheless, low temperatures prevent JAZ import, suggesting that nuclear entry
      does not occur via simple diffusion. Together, these data suggest that JAZ is
      exported by exportin-5 but translocates back into nuclei by a facilitated
      diffusion mechanism.

PG  - 139-42
AB  - The susceptibility of mobile and cystic forms of Borrelia burgdorferi to
      tinidazole (TZ) was examined. The minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) of TZ 
      against the mobile spirochetes was >128 microg/ml at 37 degrees C in micro-oxic
      atmosphere when incubated for 14 days. TZ significantly reduced the conversion of
      mobile spirochetes to cystic forms during incubation. The MBC for older
      (10-months-old) cysts at 37 degrees C in a micro-oxic atmosphere was >0.5
      microg/ml, but >0.125 microg/ml for young (1-day-old) cysts. Acridine orange
      staining, dark-field microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed
      that, when the concentration of TZ was > or = MBC, the contents of the cysts were
      partly degraded, core structures did not develop inside the young cysts, and the 
      amount of RNA in these cysts decreased significantly. When cysts were exposed to 
      TZ, both the spirochetal structures and core structures inside the cysts
      dissolved, and the production of blebs was significantly reduced. These
      observations may be valuable in the treatment of resistant infections caused by
      B. burgdorferi, and suggest that a combination of TZ and a macrolide antibiotic
      could eradicate both cystic and mobile forms of B. burgdorferi.

TI  - A novel 4-base-recognizing RNA cutter that can remove the single 3' terminal
      nucleotides from RNA molecules.
PG  - e91
AB  - Mammalian tRNase ZL shows versatility in substrate recognition. This enzyme can
      not only process pre-tRNAs by cleaving off their 3' trailer sequences, but also
      recognize and cleave pre-tRNA-like complexes and micro-pre-tRNAs. Here we
      demonstrate that 24-27 nt hairpin RNAs (hook RNAs) can guide cleavages of
      separate target RNAs by tRNase ZL through the micro-pre-tRNA-like complexes
      between the targets and the hook RNAs and that tRNase ZL together with hook RNA
      works as 4-7-base-recognizing RNA cutters. The cleavage sites were located only
      after the nucleotide corresponding to the discriminator nucleotide. Cleavage
      assays for various substrate/hooker complexes showed that the cleavage efficiency
      changes depending on the maximum number of substrate/hooker recognition base
      pairings and the stem length of hook RNA and that a 5 nt recognition sequence and
      a hook RNA containing a 6 or 7 bp stem are the best combination for the optimal
      target cleavage. We also show that a 4-base RNA cutter can remove the single 3'
      terminal nucleotides from RNA molecules. These results indicate that this new
      type of RNA cutter can be utilized to homogenize at their 3' termini RNA
      transcripts synthesized in vitro with a bacteriophage RNA polymerase.

TI  - Immunization with PfEMP1-DBL1alpha generates antibodies that disrupt rosettes and
      protect against the sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes.
PG  - 2701-12
AB  - A family of parasite antigens known as Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane
      protein 1 (PfEMP1) is believed to play an important role in the binding of
      infected erythrocytes to host receptors in the micro-vasculature. Available data 
      advocates the existence of a subset of very adhesive (rosetting,
      auto-agglutinating) and antigenic PfEMP1s implicated as virulence factors. Serum 
      antibodies that disrupt rosettes are rarely found in children with severe malaria
      but are frequent in those with mild disease suggesting that they may be
      protective. Here we have developed a Semliki forest virus (SFV) vaccine construct
      with a recombinant gene (mini-var gene) encoding a mini-PfEMP1 (DBL1alpha-TM-ATS)
      obtained from a particularly antigenic and rosetting parasite (FCR3S1.2). The
      mini-PfEMP1 is presented to the host mimicking the location of the native
      molecule at the infected erythrocyte surface. Antibodies generated by a regimen
      of priming with SFV RNA particles and boosting with a recombinant protein
      recognize the infected erythrocyte surface
      (immuno-fluorescence/rosette-disruption) and prevent the sequestration of P.
      falciparum-infected erythrocytes in an in vivo model of severe malaria. The data 
      prove the involvement of DBL1alpha in the adhesion of infected- and uninfected
      erythrocytes and the role of rosette-disruptive antibodies in preventing these
      cellular interactions. The work supports the use of DBL1alpha in a vaccine again 
      severe malaria.

TI  - The small RNA chaperone Hfq and multiple small RNAs control quorum sensing in
      Vibrio harveyi and Vibrio cholerae.
PG  - 69-82
AB  - Quorum-sensing bacteria communicate with extracellular signal molecules called
      autoinducers. This process allows community-wide synchronization of gene
      expression. A screen for additional components of the Vibrio harveyi and Vibrio
      cholerae quorum-sensing circuits revealed the protein Hfq. Hfq mediates
      interactions between small, regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) and specific messenger RNA
      (mRNA) targets. These interactions typically alter the stability of the target
      transcripts. We show that Hfq mediates the destabilization of the mRNA encoding
      the quorum-sensing master regulators LuxR (V. harveyi) and HapR (V. cholerae),
      implicating an sRNA in the circuit. Using a bioinformatics approach to identify
      putative sRNAs, we identified four candidate sRNAs in V. cholerae. The
      simultaneous deletion of all four sRNAs is required to stabilize hapR mRNA. We
      propose that Hfq, together with these sRNAs, creates an ultrasensitive regulatory
      switch that controls the critical transition into the high cell density,
      quorum-sensing mode.

TI  - Single processing center models for human Dicer and bacterial RNase III.
PG  - 57-68
AB  - Dicer is a multidomain ribonuclease that processes double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) 
      to 21 nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) during RNA interference, and excises
      microRNAs from precursor hairpins. Dicer contains two domains related to the
      bacterial dsRNA-specific endonuclease, RNase III, which is known to function as a
      homodimer. Based on an X-ray structure of the Aquifex aeolicus RNase III, models 
      of the enzyme interaction with dsRNA, and its cleavage at two composite catalytic
      centers, have been proposed. We have generated mutations in human Dicer and
      Escherichia coli RNase III residues implicated in the catalysis, and studied
      their effect on RNA processing. Our results indicate that both enzymes have only 
      one processing center, containing two RNA cleavage sites and generating products 
      with 2 nt 3' overhangs. Based on these and other data, we propose that Dicer
      functions through intramolecular dimerization of its two RNase III domains,
      assisted by the flanking RNA binding domains, PAZ and dsRBD.

TI  - Optimization of an siRNA-expression system with an improved hairpin and its
      significant suppressive effects in mammalian cells.
PG  - 715-23
AB  - BACKGROUND: RNA interference (RNAi) is a phenomenon in which expression of an
      individual gene can be specifically silenced by introducing a double-stranded
      RNA, one complementary to the gene, into cells. This phenomenon can be observed
      in mammalian cells when small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are used, and is
      receiving attention as the most powerful tool for reverse genetics in the post
      genome era. Several groups have developed vector-based siRNA-expression systems
      that can induce RNAi in living cells. METHODS: We describe here a comparative
      analysis of various siRNA-expression systems, in which we examined the effects of
      stem length, loop sequence and insertion of mutation(s) and/or bulges in the stem
      sequence on silencing effects and on the stability of the vectors. RESULTS: As a 
      result of the comparative analysis, we determined the following optimized
      siRNA-expression system: U6 promoter-driven hairpin-type dsRNA with 21-nt stem
      length, three to four mutations in the sense strand only, and the optimized 9-nt 
      loop sequence, derived from microRNA. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
      siRNA-expression system with a tetracycline-regulated U6 promoter(s) could have
      the potential to control RNAi in cells, and that the HIV vector-mediated transfer
      of an siRNA-expression cassette into cells resulted in efficient silencing of a
      target gene at a multiplicity of infection as low as five. CONCLUSION: The
      mutated hairpin siRNAs and their genetically stable coding vectors could be very 
      useful for gene knockdown experiments, and could further benefit gene therapy
      using RNAi.

PG  - 995-1000
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the evolution of pulmonary hypertension, the
      pathological changes of pulmonary arteries, and the expression of VEGFmRNA and
      eNOSmRNA of pulmonary arterial endothelial cells in immature rabbits treated with
      intratracheal bleomycin (BLM). METHODS: Immature rabbits were divided into
      control and BLM group. Two and four weeks after intratracheal normal saline or
      BLM injection, the systolic, diastolic and mean pulmonary artery pressure (PASP, 
      PADP, MPAP) were measured by micro-catheter; the pathological changes and the
      expression of VEGFmRNA and eNOSmRNA of endothelial cells in pulmonary arteries
      were evaluated by HE and in situ hybridization. RESULTS: Two and four weeks after
      intratracheal injection of BLM, the PASP, PADP and MPAP increased 53%, 49%, 52%
      in 2 weeks, and 43%, 89%, 56% in 4 weeks; the wall thickness increased and the
      cavity in middle and small pulmonary arteries became narrow; the Thickness Index 
      (TI) and Area Index (AI) increased 25%, 14% in 2 weeks, and 22%, 24% in 4 weeks; 
      the level of VEGFmRNA and eNOSmRNA expression decreased 46%, 43% in 2 weeks, and 
      43%, 51% in 4 weeks. There was no significant difference between 2 weeks and 4
      weeks BLM groups. CONCLUSION: The pulmonary artery pressure was elevated, the
      thickness of wall increased and the cavity became narrow in middle and small
      pulmonary arteries, and the level of VEGFmRNA and eNOSmRNA expression in
      pulmonary arterial endothelial cells decreased in immature rabbits after 2 weeks 
      and 4 weeks of intratracheal 4 U/kg BLM injection.

TI  - Distinct roles for Argonaute proteins in small RNA-directed RNA cleavage
      pathways.
PG  - 1655-66
AB  - In mammalian cells, both microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)
      are thought to be loaded into the same RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC),
      where they guide mRNA degradation or translation silencing depending on the
      complementarity of the target. In Drosophila, Argonaute2 (AGO2) was identified as
      part of the RISC complex. Here we show that AGO2 is an essential component for
      siRNA-directed RNA interference (RNAi) response and is required for the unwinding
      of siRNA duplex and in consequence assembly of siRNA into RISC in Drosophila
      embryos. However, Drosophila embryos lacking AGO2, which are siRNA-directed
      RNAi-defective, are still capable of miRNA-directed target RNA cleavage. In
      contrast, Argonaute1 (AGO1), another Argonaute protein in fly, which is
      dispensable for siRNA-directed target RNA cleavage, is required for mature miRNA 
      production that impacts on miRNA-directed RNA cleavage. The association of AGO1
      with Dicer-1 and pre-miRNA also suggests that AGO1 is involved in miRNA
      biogenesis. Our findings show that distinct Argonaute proteins act at different
      steps of the small RNA silencing mechanism and suggest that there are inherent
      differences between siRNA-initiated RISCs and miRNA-initiated RISCs in
      Drosophila.

TI  - Dietary copper restriction-induced changes in myocardial gene expression and the 
      effect of copper repletion.
PG  - 616-22
AB  - Dietary copper (Cu) restriction leads to cardiac hypertrophy and failure in mice,
      and Cu repletion (CuR) reverses the hypertrophy and prevents the transition to
      heart failure. The present study was undertaken to determine changes in
      myocardial gene expression involved in Cu deficient (CuD) cardiomyopathy and its 
      reversal by CuR. Analysis was performed on three groups of mice: 4-week-old CuD
      mice that exhibited signs of cardiac failure, their age-matched copper-adequate
      (CuA) controls, and the CuD mice that were re-fed adequate Cu for 2 weeks. Total 
      RNA was isolated from hearts and subjected to cDNA micro-array and real-time
      reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Dietary CuD caused a
      decrease in cardiac mRNA of beta-MHC, L-type Ca(2+) channel, K-dependent NCX,
      MMP-2, -8, and -13, NF-kappaB, and VEGF. The mRNA levels of ET-1, TGF-beta,
      TNF-alpha, and procollagen-I-alpha1 and III-alpha1 were increased in the CuD
      cardiac tissue. Copper repletion resulted in cardiac mRNA levels of most of the
      genes examined returning to control levels, although the K-dependent NCX and
      MMP-2 values did not reach those of the CuA control. In addition, CuR caused an
      increase in beta-MHC, L-type Ca(2+)channel, MMP-13 to levels surpassing those of 
      CuA control, and a decrease in ET-1, and TNF-alpha mRNA levels. In summary,
      changes in gene expression of elements involved in contractility, Ca(2+) cycling,
      and inflammation and fibrosis may account for the altered cardiac function found 
      in CuD mice. The return to normal cardiac function by CuR may be a result of the 
      favorable regression in gene expression of these critical components in
      myocardial tissue.

PG  - 332-4
AB  - To explore a new way to treat CML, inhibitory effect of small interfering RNA
      (SiRNA) on bcr-abl fusion gene expression of K562 cell line was studied. SiRNA
      for bcr-abl gene was designed and transfected into K562 cells, bcr-abl gene
      expression was tested by RT-PCR. The results showed that bcr-abl gene expression 
      was inhibited by using siRNA in dose-dependent manner and reduced to 19.9% and
      26.6% of the control at 24 and 48 hours after transfection with 0.2 micro g siRNA
      respectively. K562 cells proliferation was suppressed finally, but bcr-abl gene
      expression restored at 72 hours. In conclusion, anti-bcr-abl siRNA can
      effectively inhibit bcr-abl gene expression of K562 cell line.

TI  - Somatic and axonal effects of ATP via P2X2 but not P2X7 receptors in rat
      thoracolumbar sympathetic neurones.
PG  - 359-67
AB  - Excitatory ATP responses in rat cultured thoracolumbar sympathetic neurones are
      mediated by somatic P2X(2) receptors. The present study investigated a possible
      role of axonal P2X(2) as well as P2X(7) receptors on the same preparation.
      Confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated P2X(2) and P2X(7)
      immunoreactivity along the axons as well as P2X(7) immunoreactivity surrounding
      the cell nuclei. P2X(7) mRNA expression was detected in individual neurones using
      a single-cell RT-PCR approach. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) caused a significant 
      increase in axonal Ca(2+) concentration which was dependent on external Ca(2+)
      but insensitive to depletion of the cellular Ca(2+) pools by cyclopiazonic acid. 
      Pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonate (PPADS; 30 micro m) virtually
      abolished the ATP response, whereas brilliant blue G (0.1 micro m), a selective
      P2X(7) receptor antagonist, had no effect. Dibenzoyl-ATP (BzATP; 100 micro m)
      induced a much smaller increase in axonal [Ca(2+)] concentration than ATP at
      equimolar concentrations. The response to BzATP was distinctly reduced by PPADS
      but not by brilliant blue G. The overall pharmacological profile of the axonal
      P2X receptors resembled closely that of the somatic P2X(2) receptors. In
      conclusion, the present data suggest the occurrence of axonal excitatory P2X(2)
      receptors in thoracolumbar sympathetic neurones. However, the functional
      significance of axonal and (peri)-nuclear P2X(7) receptors has still to be
      proven.

TI  - Modulation of floral development by a gibberellin-regulated microRNA.
PG  - 3357-65
AB  - Floral initiation and floral organ development are both regulated by the
      phytohormone gibberellin (GA). For example, in short-day photoperiods, the
      Arabidopsis floral transition is strongly promoted by GA-mediated activation of
      the floral meristem-identity gene LEAFY. In addition, anther development and
      pollen microsporogenesis depend on GA-mediated opposition of the function of
      specific members of the DELLA family of GA-response repressors. We describe the
      role of a microRNA (miR159) in the regulation of short-day photoperiod flowering 
      time and of anther development. MiR159 directs the cleavage of mRNA encoding
      GAMYB-related proteins. These proteins are transcription factors that are thought
      to be involved in the GA-promoted activation of LEAFY, and in the regulation of
      anther development. We show that miR159 levels are regulated by GA via opposition
      of DELLA function, and that both the sequence of miR159 and the regulation of
      miR159 levels by DELLA are evolutionarily conserved. Finally, we describe the
      phenotypic consequences of transgenic over-expression of miR159. Increased levels
      of miR159 cause a reduction in LEAFY transcript levels, delay flowering in
      short-day photoperiods, and perturb anther development. We propose that miR159 is
      a phytohormonally regulated homeostatic modulator of GAMYB activity, and hence of
      GAMYB-dependent developmental processes.

PG  - 361-6
LID - 10.1111/j.1364-3703.2004.00227.x [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY Eukaryotic small RNA comprises several classes of 21-25 nucleotide
      non-coding RNA, of which microRNA (miRNA) has gained a great deal of attention
      because it is directly involved in controlling growth and development in plants. 
      miRNAs are processed by the RNase III-like Dicer, although recent studies have
      implicated additional gene products in the step-wise maturation of miRNAs from
      their primary nuclear transcripts. They function as sequence-specific guides to
      trigger cleavage or translational repression of target mRNAs that have
      complementary sequences. Natural miRNA targets encode members of large families
      of transcription factors, which are collectively required for a number of
      developmental processes. In addition to developmental regulation, some miRNAs
      might be involved in specific physiological responses to several types of
      stresses, such as those induced by pathogen infections. Strikingly, the
      potyviruses, the largest group of plant RNA viruses, are able to interfere with
      miRNA-guided cleavage of multiple regulatory targets in plants, thus modulating
      gene expression of the host cell.

TI  - Molecular architecture of CAG repeats in human disease related transcripts.
PG  - 665-79
AB  - CAG repeats are present in numerous human transcripts but neither their
      structures nor physiological functions have been satisfactorily recognized. The
      expanded CAG repeats are present in transcripts from several mutant genes
      associated with hereditary neurodegenerative diseases but their contribution to
      pathogenesis has not been documented convincingly. Here, we show that the
      structures formed by the repeats and their natural flanking sequences in the
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 3 and type 6, and dentatorubral-palidoluysian
      atrophy (DRPLA) transcripts have different molecular architectures which may have
      functional meaning. We provide evidence that the hairpin structure formed by CAG 
      repeats in mRNA fragments is preserved in full-length mRNA. We also demonstrate
      that the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that is located immediately
      adjacent (3') to the repeats of the SCA3 transcript modulates the structures
      formed by these sequences, and may have functional significance, as only one of
      its variants is selected in human evolution.

AB  - RNAi, a novel strategy of gene-silencing induced by dsRNA, has recently become an
      important topic of discussion. dsRNAs introduced into a living body are processed
      by an enzyme known as the Dicer and become fractions of 21-23 nt RNAs (siRNA),
      after which they form protein complexes known as RNA-induced silencing complexes 
      (RISC). The resulting RISC recognizes cognate mRNAs and cleave them. There are 2 
      ways to introduce dsRNAs to a living body: direct introduction of synthetic
      dsRNAs, and introduction of DNA templates into cells, followed by production of
      dsRNAs by transcription. Now that we can apply RNAi technologies into a living
      body, RNAi has become a widely used tool due to its great simplicity and high
      efficiency. However, there are still problems to be solved for more efficient use
      of RNAi. There are a wide range of applications such as analysis of gene
      functions and gene therapy. It is suggested that small RNAs, called miRNAs, exist
      in a living body and bind mRNAs to repress their translations. miRNA plays a
      great role in gene regulation and control of the differentiation and development 
      of cells.

TI  - Evidence that microRNA precursors, unlike other non-coding RNAs, have lower
      folding free energies than random sequences.
PG  - 2911-7
AB  - MOTIVATION: Most non-coding RNAs are characterized by a specific secondary and
      tertiary structure that determines their function. Here, we investigate the
      folding energy of the secondary structure of non-coding RNA sequences, such as
      microRNA precursors, transfer RNAs and ribosomal RNAs in several eukaryotic taxa.
      Statistical biases are assessed by a randomization test, in which the predicted
      minimum free energy of folding is compared with values obtained for structures
      inferred from randomly shuffling the original sequences. RESULTS: In contrast
      with transfer RNAs and ribosomal RNAs, the majority of the microRNA sequences
      clearly exhibit a folding free energy that is considerably lower than that for
      shuffled sequences, indicating a high tendency in the sequence towards a stable
      secondary structure. A possible usage of this statistical test in the framework
      of the detection of genuine miRNA sequences is discussed.

TI  - The ERPIN server: an interface to profile-based RNA motif identification.
PG  - W160-5
AB  - ERPIN is an RNA motif identification program that takes an RNA sequence alignment
      as an input and identifies related sequences using a profile-based dynamic
      programming algorithm. ERPIN differs from other RNA motif search programs in its 
      ability to capture subtle biases in the training set and produce highly specific 
      and sensitive searches, while keeping CPU requirements at a practical level. In
      its latest version, ERPIN also computes E-values, which tell biologists how
      likely they are to encounter a specific sequence match by chance-a useful
      indication of biological significance. We present here the ERPIN online search
      interface (http://tagc.univ-mrs.fr/erpin/). This web server automatically
      performs ERPIN searches for different RNA genes or motifs, using predefined
      training sets and search parameters. With a couple of clicks, users can analyze
      an entire bacterial genome or a genomic segment of up to 5Mb for the presence of 
      tRNAs, 5S rRNAs, SRP RNA, C/D box snoRNAs, hammerhead motifs, miRNAs and other
      motifs. Search results are displayed with sequence, score, position, E-value and 
      secondary structure graphics. An example of a complete genome scan is provided,
      as well as an evaluation of run times and specificity/sensitivity information for
      all available motifs.

TI  - Antioxidant intervention prevents renal neovascularization in
      hypercholesterolemic pigs.
PG  - 1816-25
AB  - Experimental hypercholesterolemia (HC) may lead to microvascular
      neovascularization, but the underlying pathogenic mechanism remains unclear. We
      tested the hypothesis that HC-induced intra-renal neovascularization is
      associated with inflammation and increased oxidative stress, and would be
      prevented by chronic antioxidant intervention. Kidneys were excised from pigs
      after a 12-wk normal (n = 10) or HC diet (n = 8), or HC diet supplemented daily
      with antioxidant vitamins C (1 g) and E (100 IU/kg) (HC + vitamins, n = 7). Renal
      cortical samples were then scanned three dimensionally with micro-computed
      tomography, and microvessels were counted in situ. Blood and tissue samples were 
      removed for measurements of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, protein
      expression of the NADP(H)-oxidase subunits gp91phox, p47phox, and p67phox,
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels and mRNA, VEGF receptors (Flt-1 
      and Flk-1), the proinflammatory transcription factor NFkappaB, and the oxidized
      LDL receptor LOX-1. Microvascular spatial density was significantly elevated in
      HC compared with normal kidneys but preserved in HC + vitamins. Expression of
      gp91phox and p67phox was decreased in HC pigs after antioxidant intervention, and
      SOD improved. The increased renal expression of VEGF and Flk-1 in HC was blunted 
      in HC + vitamins, as were the significant increases in LOX-1, NFkappaB, and
      interstitial fibrosis. This study shows that renal cortical neovascularization
      elicited by diet-induced HC is associated with renal inflammation, fibrosis, and 
      upregulation of VEGF and its receptor Flk-1, likely mediated by increased
      endogenous oxidative stress. Chronic antioxidant supplementation may preserve the
      kidney in HC.

TI  - The rate and pattern of cladogenesis in microbes.
PG  - 946-55
AB  - Theories of macroevolution rarely have been extended to include microbes;
      however, because microbes represent the most ancient and diverse assemblage of
      organismal diversity, such oversight limits our understanding of evolutionary
      history. Our analysis of phylogenetic trees for microbes suggests that
      macroevolution may differ between prokaryotes and both micro- and macroeukaryotes
      (mainly plants and animals). Phylogenetic trees inferred for prokaryotes and some
      microbial eukaryotes conformed to expectations assuming a constant rate of
      cladogenesis over time and among lineages: nevertheless, microbial eukaryote
      trees exhibited more variation in rates of cladogenesis than prokaryote trees. We
      hypothesize that the contrast of macroevolutionary dynamics between prokaryotes
      and many eukaryotes is due, at least in part, to differences in the prevalence of
      lateral gene transfer (LGT) between the two groups. Inheritance is predominantly,
      if not wholly, vertical within eukaryotes, a feature that allows for the
      emergence and maintenance of heritable variation among lineages. By contrast,
      frequent LGT in prokaryotes may ameliorate heritable variation in rate of
      cladogenesis resulting from the emergence of key innovations; thus, the inferred 
      difference in macroevolution might reflect exclusivity of key innovations in
      eukaryotes and their promiscuous nature in prokaryotes.

PG  - 9740-4
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNA genes recently found to be 
      abnormally expressed in several types of cancer. Here, we describe a recently
      developed methodology for miRNA gene expression profiling based on the
      development of a microchip containing oligonucleotides corresponding to 245
      miRNAs from human and mouse genomes. We used these microarrays to obtain highly
      reproducible results that revealed tissue-specific miRNA expression signatures,
      data that were confirmed by assessment of expression by Northern blots, real-time
      RT-PCR, and literature search. The microchip oligolibrary can be expanded to
      include an increasing number of miRNAs discovered in various species and is
      useful for the analysis of normal and disease states.

TI  - Efficient downregulation of immunoglobulin mu mRNA with premature

PG  - 3304-15
AB  - Premature translation-termination codons (PTCs) elicit rapid degradation of the
      mRNA by a process called nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). NMD appears to be
      significantly more efficient for mRNAs of genes belonging to the immunoglobulin
      superfamily, which frequently acquire PTCs during VDJ rearrangment, than for
      mRNAs of other genes. To identify determinants for efficient NMD, we developed a 
      minigene system derived from a mouse immunoglobulin micro gene (Ig-micro) and
      measured the effect of PTCs at different positions on the mRNA level. This
      revealed that PTCs located downstream of the V-D junction in the VDJ exon of
      Ig-micro minigenes and of endogenous Ig-micro genes elicit very strong mRNA
      downregulation, whereas NMD efficiency decreases gradually further upstream in
      the V segment where a PTC was inserted. Interestingly, two PTCs are in positions 
      where they usually do not trigger NMD (<50 nt from the 3'-most 5' splice site)
      still resulted in reduced mRNA levels. Using a set of hybrid constructs comprised
      of Ig-micro and an inefficient substrate for NMD, we identified a 177 nt long
      element in the V segment that is necessary for efficient downregulation of
      PTC-containing hybrid transcripts. Moreover, deletion of this NMD-promoting
      element from the Ig-micro minigene results in loss of strong NMD.

TI  - Quantitation of microRNAs using a modified Invader assay.
PG  - 1153-61
AB  - The short lengths of microRNAs (miRNAs) present a significant challenge for
      detection and quantitation using conventional methods for RNA analysis. To
      address this problem, we developed a quantitative, sensitive, and rapid miRNA
      assay based on our previously described messenger RNA Invader assay. This assay
      was used successfully in the analysis of several miRNAs, using as little as
      50-100 ng of total cellular RNA or as few as 1,000 lysed cells. Its specificity
      allowed for discrimination between miRNAs differing by a single nucleotide, and
      between precursor and mature miRNAs. The Invader miRNA assay, which can be
      performed in unfractionated detergent lysates, uses fluorescence detection in
      microtiter plates and requires only 2-3 h incubation time, allowing for parallel 
      analysis of multiple samples in high-throughput screening analyses.

TI  - A non-consensus branch point plays an important role in determining the stability
      of the 2-kb LAT intron during acute and latent infections of herpes simplex virus
      type-1.
PG  - 340-9
AB  - Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) establishes lifelong latent infection in
      sensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system. During HSV latency, the
      latency-associated transcripts (LATs) are the only viral transcripts abundantly
      expressed. The most abundant form of LATs is a 2-kb stable intron spliced from a 
      primary transcript (mLAT). It has been previously reported that a non-consensus
      branch point influences the stability of the intron (in vitro) in cells
      transfected with plasmid constructs (J. Virol. 71 (1997) 5849; J. Virol. 71
      (1997) 4199). However, it is unknown whether this branch point is important in
      determining LAT stability in vivo (in the context of virus). To study the role of
      this stable intron in HSV-1 infection, we have constructed a mutant virus
      KOS-CONS in which the branch point has been mutated to consensus branch point
      nucleotides. The accumulation of the 2-kb intron in KOS-CONS-infected cells was
      greatly reduced. The LAT intron was not detectable in KOS-CONS-infected mouse
      trigeminal ganglia (TG) during acute and latent phase infection by Northern blot 
      analysis. Replication of the KOS-CONS and the wild-type KOS viruses on Vero cells
      was determined to be similar, as was the level of HSV-1 DNA in mouse trigeminal
      ganglia during acute and latent phase infection. Using the mouse TG explant
      model, the reactivation pattern of both viruses was shown to be similar. Our data
      suggest that the unique branch point plays a significant role in determining the 
      stability of LAT intron in vivo, but that the stability of the intron does not
      appear to affect HSV-1 replication, the establishment of latency, or viral
      reactivation.

TI  - Field-specific changes in hippocampal opioid mRNA, peptides, and receptors due to
      prenatal morphine exposure in adult male rats.
PG  - 355-64
AB  - Alterations in the opioid system in the hippocampal formation and some of the
      possible functional consequences were investigated in adult male rats that were
      prenatally exposed to either saline or morphine (10 mg/kg twice daily on
      gestational days 11-18). In situ hybridization and Northern blots were used to
      measure proenkephalin and prodynorphin mRNA, and radioimmunoassays quantified
      proenkephalin- and prodynorphin-derived peptide levels in the dentate gyrus, CA3,
      and CA1 subfields of the hippocampal formation. Prenatal morphine exposure in
      male rats decreases proenkephalin and increases prodynorphin mRNA selectively in 
      the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. Similarly, met-enkephalin peptide
      levels are decreased and dynorphin B peptide levels are increased in the dentate 
      gyrus but not CA3 or CA1 of prenatally morphine-exposed males. In addition, there
      are decreases in dynorphin-derived peptides in the CA3 subfield. Receptor
      autoradiography revealed increases in the density of micro but not delta receptor
      labeling in discrete strata of specific hippocampal subfields in morphine-exposed
      males. Because alterations in the hippocampal opioid system suggest possible
      alterations in the excitability of the hippocampal formation, changes in opioid
      regulation of seizures were examined. Morphine exposure, however, does not alter 
      the latency to onset or number of episodes of wet dog shakes or clonic seizures
      induced by infusion of 10 nmol [D-Ala2, MePhe4, Gly-ol5]enkephalin into the
      ventral hippocampal formation. Interestingly, a naloxone (5 mg/kg) injection 30
      min before bicuculline administration reverses the increased latency to onset of 
      clonic and tonic-clonic seizures in morphine-exposed males. Thus, the present
      study suggests that exposure of rats to morphine during early development alters 
      the hippocampal opioid system, suggesting possible consequences for
      hippocampal-mediated functions.

TI  - MicroRNA regulation of NAC-domain targets is required for proper formation and
      separation of adjacent embryonic, vegetative, and floral organs.
PG  - 1035-46
AB  - BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 21 nucleotide (nt) RNAs that
      regulate gene expression in plants and animals. Most known plant miRNAs target
      transcription factors that influence cell fate determination, and biological
      functions of miRNA-directed regulation have been reported for four of 15 known
      microRNA gene families: miR172, miR159, miR165, and miR168. Here, we identify a
      developmental role for miR164-directed regulation of NAC-domain genes, which
      encode a family of transcription factors that includes CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON1
      (CUC1) and CUC2. RESULTS: Expression of a miR164-resistant version of CUC1 mRNA
      from the CUC1 promoter causes alterations in Arabidopsis embryonic, vegetative,
      and floral development, including cotyledon orientation defects, reduction of
      rosette leaf petioles, dramatically misshapen rosette leaves, one to four extra
      petals, and one or two missing sepals. Reciprocally, constitutive overexpression 
      of miR164 recapitulates cuc1 cuc2 double mutant phenotypes, including cotyledon
      and floral organ fusions. miR164 overexpression also leads to phenotypes not
      previously observed in cuc1 cuc2 mutants, including leaf and stem fusions. These 
      likely reflect the misregulation of other NAC-domain mRNAs, including NAC1,
      At5g07680, and At5g61430, for which miR164-directed cleavage products were
      detected. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that miR164-directed regulation 
      of CUC1 is necessary for normal embryonic, vegetative, and floral development.
      They also show that proper miR164 dosage or localization is required for
      separation of adjacent embryonic, vegetative, and floral organs, thus implicating
      miR164 as a common regulatory component of the molecular circuitry that controls 
      the separation of different developing organs and thereby exposes a
      posttranscriptional layer of NAC-domain gene regulation during plant development.

TI  - Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors counteract diabetes- and hypoxia-induced
      retinal vascular endothelial growth factor overexpression.
PG  - 55-64
AB  - We hypothesize that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activation is an important
      mechanism in the oxidative stress-related development of diabetic retinopathy. In
      the experiments reported here, we evaluated if: a) PARP activation is present in 
      the retina in short-term diabetes; and b) PARP inhibitors, 3-aminobenzamide and
      1,5-isoquinolinediol, counteract diabetes- and hypoxia-induced retinal VEGF
      formation. In vivo studies were performed in control and streptozotocin-diabetic 
      rats treated with/without 3-aminobenzamide or 1,5-isoquinolinediol (30 and 3
      mg/kg per day, intraperitoneally, for 2 weeks after 2 weeks of diabetes). In
      vitro studies were performed in human retinal pigment epithelial cells exposed to
      normoxia or hypoxia with/without 3-aminobenzamide and 1,5-isoquinolinediol at 200
      and 2 micro M. Retinal immunostaining for poly(ADP-ribose) was increased and NAD 
      concentration reduced in diabetic rats, and both variables were corrected by PARP
      inhibitors. Retinal VEGF protein (ELISA, immunohistochemistry), but not mRNA
      (ribonuclease protection assay) abundance, was increased in diabetic rats, and
      this increase was corrected by both 3-aminobenzamide and 1,5-isoquinolinediol.
      PARP inhibitors did not affect retinal glucose, sorbitol pathway intermediates or
      lipid peroxidation in diabetic rats. Hypoxia caused a several-fold increase in
      both VEGF-mRNA and protein in retinal pigment epithelial cells. VEGF mRNA
      overexpression was only slighly blunted by PARP inhibitors whereas VEGF protein
      was corrected. In conclusion, PARP is involved in diabetes- and hypoxia-induced
      VEGF production at post-transcriptional level, downstream from the sorbitol
      pathway activation and oxidative stress. The results justify studies of PARP
      inhibitors in models of retinopathy of prematurity and diabetic retinopathy.

TI  - Complex p63 mRNA isoform expression patterns in squamous cell carcinoma of the
      head and neck.
PG  - 27-35
AB  - The human p63 gene encodes a series of protein isoforms that differ in their N-
      and/or C-terminal sequences and possess widely varying activities in promoting or
      repressing p53-related functions and in regulating the proliferation and
      differentiation of epithelial cells. To gain further information on the role of
      p63 expression in human tumours, we used quantitative real-time RT-PCR to study
      individual p63 isoforms in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN).
      In keeping with previous reports, expression of the deltaN- and p63alpha-isoforms
      predominated and deltaNp63 mRNA was expressed at significantly higher levels in
      tumours compared to matched normal tissues. Some tumours also expressed the
      highly efficient transactivator TA- and p63beta-isoforms, and p63beta was
      significantly increased in tumours compared to matched normal tissue. We could
      not identify any correlations between different p63-isoform expression patterns
      and proliferation, p53 status, or telomerase expression. All p63 isoforms could
      be identified in normal surface epithelium, and micro-dissection showed that the 
      high levels present in basal layers were similar to those seen in tumour tissues.
      Thus, high-level expression of deltaNp63 in tumour cells may represent maintained
      expression by the basal cells from which the tumour arose, rather than
      representing a true over-expression of p63 during tumourigenesis. Tobacco usage, 
      a genotoxic predisposing factor for SCCHN, had no effect on p63 expression in
      oral epithelium. Taken together, our data indicate that SCCHN maintain expression
      of high levels of deltaNp63alpha in combination with varying levels of other p63 
      isoforms, some of which are highly efficient transcriptional activators. The
      complexity of these p63 expression patterns seen in primary SCCHN indicates that 
      p63 has multifaceted roles in tumour biology.

TI  - The C. elegans Polycomb gene SOP-2 encodes an RNA binding protein.
PG  - 841-7
AB  - Epigenetic silencing of Hox cluster genes by Polycomb group (PcG) proteins is
      thought to involve the formation of a stably inherited repressive chromatin
      structure. Here we show that the C. elegans-specific PcG protein SOP-2 directly
      binds to RNA through three nonoverlapping regions, each of which is essential for
      its localization to characteristic nuclear bodies and for its in vivo function in
      the repression of Hox genes. Functional studies indicate that the RNA involved in
      SOP-2 binding is distinct from either siRNA or microRNA. Remarkably, the
      vertebrate PcG protein Rae28, which is functionally and structurally related to
      SOP-2, also binds to RNA through an FCS finger domain. Substitution of the Rae28 
      FCS finger for the essential RNA binding region of SOP-2 partially restores
      localization to nuclear bodies. These observations suggest that direct binding to
      RNA is an evolutionarily conserved and potentially important property of PcG
      proteins.

TI  - Computational identification of plant microRNAs and their targets, including a
      stress-induced miRNA.
PG  - 787-99
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 21-nucleotide RNAs, some of which have been 
      shown to play important gene-regulatory roles during plant development. We
      developed comparative genomic approaches to systematically identify both miRNAs
      and their targets that are conserved in Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza
      sativa). Twenty-three miRNA candidates, representing seven newly identified gene 
      families, were experimentally validated in Arabidopsis, bringing the total number
      of reported miRNA genes to 92, representing 22 families. Nineteen newly
      identified target candidates were confirmed by detecting mRNA fragments
      diagnostic of miRNA-directed cleavage in plants. Overall, plant miRNAs have a
      strong propensity to target genes controlling development, particularly those of 
      transcription factors and F-box proteins. However, plant miRNAs have conserved
      regulatory functions extending beyond development, in that they also target
      superoxide dismutases, laccases, and ATP sulfurylases. The expression of miR395, 
      the sulfurylase-targeting miRNA, increases upon sulfate starvation, showing that 
      miRNAs can be induced by environmental stress.

TI  - Nerve injury alters profile of receptor-mediated Ca2+ channel modulation in vagal
      afferent neurons of rat nodose ganglia.
PG  - 189-94
AB  - Although nerve injury is known to up- and down-regulate some metabotropic
      receptors in vagal afferent neurons of the nodose ganglia (NG), the functional
      significance has not been elucidated. In the present study, thus, we examined
      whether nerve injury affected receptor-mediated Ca2+ channel modulation in the NG
      neurons. In this regard, unilateral vagotomy was performed using male
      Sprague-Dawley rats. One week after vagotomy, Ca2+ currents were recorded using
      the whole-cell variant of patch-clamp technique in enzymatically dissociated NG
      neurons. In sham controls, norepinephrine (NE)-induced Ca2+ current inhibition
      was negligible. Following vagotomy, however, the NE responses were dramatically
      increased. This phenomenon was in accordance with up-regulation of
      alpha2A/B-adrenergic receptor mRNAs as quantified using real-time RT-PCR
      analysis. In addition, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and prostaglandin E2 responses were
      moderately augmented in vagotomized NG neurons. The altered NPY response appears 
      to be caused by up-regulation of Y2 receptors negatively coupled to Ca2+
      channels. In contrast, nerve injury significantly suppressed opioid (tested with 
      DAMGO)-induced Ca2+ current inhibition with down-regulation of micro-receptors.
      Taken together, these results demonstrated for the first time that the profile of
      neurotransmitter-induced Ca2+ channel modulation is significantly altered in the 
      NG neurons under pathophysiological state of nerve injury.

TI  - Expanding roles for miRNAs and siRNAs in cell regulation.
PG  - 127-33
AB  - The role of small RNAs as key regulators of mRNA turnover and translation has
      been well established. Recent advances indicate that the small RNAs termed
      microRNAs play important roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis and
      differentiation. Moreover, the microRNA mechanism is an efficient means to
      regulate production of a diverse range of proteins. As new microRNAs and their
      mRNA targets rapidly emerge, it is becoming apparent that RNA-based regulation of
      mRNAs may rival ubiquitination as a mechanism to control protein levels.

TI  - RNAi in functional genomics.
PG  - 129-35
AB  - There has been a lack of powerful tools for systematic analysis of mammalian gene
      function, but RNA interference (RNAi) may now provide such a strategy. Stable
      transcription of RNAi triggers from suitable expression cassettes integrated into
      the host cell genome by viral gene transfer can induce long-term and heritable
      gene silencing in mammalian cells. However, the use of RNAi as a genetic tool is 
      limited by difficulties in identifying efficient RNAi triggers, the problem of
      effective delivery and off-target effects, as well as potential genotoxic side
      effects of viral gene transfer strategies. Recent insights into the molecular
      mechanisms of silencing processes mediated by either siRNA or miRNA will allow
      further optimization of RNAi triggers as genetic tools.

TI  - MicroRNA-directed cleavage of Nicotiana sylvestris PHAVOLUTA mRNA regulates the
      vascular cambium and structure of apical meristems.
PG  - 1730-40
AB  - Leaf initiation in the peripheral zone of the shoot apical meristem involves a
      transition to determinate cell fate, but indeterminacy is maintained in the
      vascular cambium, a tissue critical to the continuous growth of vascular tissue
      in leaves and stems. We show that the orientation of cambial growth is regulated 
      by microRNA (miRNA)-directed cleavage of mRNA from the Nicotiana sylvestris
      ortholog of PHAVOLUTA (NsPHAV). Loss of miRNA regulation in semidominant phv1
      mutants misdirects lateral growth of leaf midveins and stem vasculature away from
      the shoot, disrupting vascular connections in stem nodes. The phv1 mutation also 
      expands the central zone in vegetative and inflorescence meristems, implicating
      miRNA and NsPHAV in regulation of meristem structure. In flowers, phv1 causes
      reiteration of carpel initiation, a phenocopy for loss of CARPEL FACTORY/DICER
      LIKE1, indicating that miRNA is critical to the termination of indeterminacy in
      floral meristems. Results point to a common role for miRNA in spatial and
      temporal restriction of HD-ZIPIII mediated indeterminacy in apical and vascular
      meristems.

TI  - Microbial communities in oil-contaminated seawater.
PG  - 205-14
AB  - Although diverse bacteria capable of degrading petroleum hydrocarbons have been
      isolated and characterized, the vast majority of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, 
      including anaerobes, could remain undiscovered, as a large fraction of bacteria
      inhabiting marine environments are uncultivable. Using culture-independent rRNA
      approaches, changes in the structure of microbial communities have been analyzed 
      in marine environments contaminated by a real oil spill and in micro- or
      mesocosms that mimic such environments. Alcanivorax and Cycloclasticus of the
      gamma-Proteobacteria were identified as two key organisms with major roles in the
      degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons. Alcanivorax is responsible for alkane
      biodegradation, whereas Cycloclasticus degrades various aromatic hydrocarbons.
      This information will be useful to develop in situ bioremediation strategies for 
      the clean-up of marine oil spills.

TI  - Dynamics of molecular motors and polymer translocation with sequence
      heterogeneity.
PG  - 3373-91
AB  - The effect of sequence heterogeneity on polynucleotide translocation across a
      pore and on simple models of molecular motors such as helicases, DNA
      polymerase/exonuclease, and RNA polymerase is studied in detail. Pore
      translocation of RNA or DNA is biased due to the different chemical environments 
      on the two sides of the membrane, whereas the molecular motor motion is biased
      through a coupling to chemical energy. An externally applied force can oppose
      these biases. For both systems we solve lattice models exactly both with and
      without disorder. The models incorporate explicitly the coupling to the different
      chemical environments for polymer translocation and the coupling to the chemical 
      energy (as well as nucleotide pairing energies) for molecular motors. Using the
      exact solutions and general arguments, we show that the heterogeneity leads to
      anomalous dynamics. Most notably, over a range of forces around the stall force
      (or stall tension for DNA polymerase/exonuclease systems) the displacement grows 
      sublinearly as t(micro), with micro < 1. The range over which this behavior can
      be observed experimentally is estimated for several systems and argued to be
      detectable for appropriate forces and buffers. Similar sequence heterogeneity
      effects may arise in the packing of viral DNA.

      spacer region.
PG  - 191-204
AB  - AIM: In this study, we evaluated, the use of universal primers, specific for the 
      16S-23S rRNA intergenic region, to detect and identify nine species that are of
      high interest for the microbiological control of water. METHODS AND RESULTS: The 
      analysis of the fragments was carried out using a High Resolution
      acrylamide/bisacrylamide gels in a fluorescent automated DNA sequencer. The
      results showed specific profiles for each of the nine species but this technique 
      failed to detect simultaneously micro-organisms in samples containing a mixed
      population. CONCLUSION: Nevertheless, the electrophoretic profiles obtained
      provided a very useful tool for the rapid and specific identification of water

TI  - Human embryonic stem cells express a unique set of microRNAs.
PG  - 488-98
AB  - Human embryonic stem (hES) cells are pluripotent cell lines established from the 
      explanted inner cell mass of human blastocysts. Despite their importance for
      human embryology and regenerative medicine, studies on hES cells, unlike those on
      mouse ES (mES) cells, have been hampered by difficulties in culture and by scant 
      knowledge concerning the regulatory mechanism. Recent evidence from plants and
      animals indicates small RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides (nt), collectively
      named microRNAs, play important roles in developmental regulation. Here we
      describe 36 miRNAs (from 32 stem-loops) identified by cDNA cloning in hES cells. 
      Importantly, most of the newly cloned miRNAs are specifically expressed in hES
      cells and downregulated during development into embryoid bodies (EBs), while
      miRNAs previously reported from other human cell types are poorly expressed in
      hES cells. We further show that some of the ES-specific miRNA genes are highly
      related to each other, organized as clusters, and transcribed as polycistronic
      primary transcripts. These miRNA gene families have murine homologues that have
      similar genomic organizations and expression patterns, suggesting that they may
      operate key regulatory networks conserved in mammalian pluripotent stem cells.
      The newly identified hES-specific miRNAs may also serve as molecular markers for 
      the early embryonic stage and for undifferentiated hES cells.

TI  - How many novel eukaryotic 'kingdoms'? Pitfalls and limitations of environmental
      DNA surveys.
PG  - 13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the past few years, the use of molecular techniques to detect
      cultivation-independent, eukaryotic diversity has proven to be a powerful
      approach. Based on small-subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene analyses, these
      studies have revealed the existence of an unexpected variety of new phylotypes.
      Some of them represent novel diversity in known eukaryotic groups, mainly
      stramenopiles and alveolates. Others do not seem to be related to any molecularly
      described lineage, and have been proposed to represent novel eukaryotic kingdoms.
      In order to review the evolutionary importance of this novel high-level
      eukaryotic diversity critically, and to test the potential technical and
      analytical pitfalls and limitations of eukaryotic environmental DNA surveys
      (EES), we analysed 484 environmental SSU rRNA gene sequences, including 81 new
      sequences from sediments of the small river, the Seymaz (Geneva, Switzerland).
      RESULTS: Based on a detailed screening of an exhaustive alignment of eukaryotic
      SSU rRNA gene sequences and the phylogenetic re-analysis of previously published 
      environmental sequences using Bayesian methods, our results suggest that the
      number of novel higher-level taxa revealed by previously published EES was
      overestimated. Three main sources of errors are responsible for this situation:
      (1) the presence of undetected chimeric sequences; (2) the misplacement of
      several fast-evolving sequences; and (3) the incomplete sampling of described,
      but yet unsequenced eukaryotes. Additionally, EES give a biased view of the
      diversity present in a given biotope because of the difficult amplification of
      SSU rRNA genes in some taxonomic groups. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental DNA surveys
      undoubtedly contribute to reveal many novel eukaryotic lineages, but there is no 
      clear evidence for a spectacular increase of the diversity at the kingdom level. 
      After re-analysis of previously published data, we found only five candidate
      lineages of possible novel high-level eukaryotic taxa, two of which comprise
      several phylotypes that were found independently in different studies. To
      ascertain their taxonomic status, however, the organisms themselves have now to
      be identified.

TI  - Trans10,cis12-18:2 is a more potent inhibitor of de novo fatty acid synthesis and
      desaturation than cis9,trans11-18:2 in the mammary gland of lactating mice.
PG  - 1362-8
AB  - To investigate the effects of 2 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomers and
      trans11-18:1 (TVA) on de novo lipogenesis and desaturation in liver and mammary
      gland, lactating mice were fed diets containing 3% canola oil (control) or 2%
      canola oil plus 1% stearic acid (SA), TVA, cis9,trans11 CLA (c9t11), or
      trans10,cis12 CLA (t10c12). In mammary tissue, TVA and CLA isomers reduced mRNA
      for acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) compared with
      control, but only c9t11 and t10c12 reduced mammary ACC activity. Of the 2 CLA
      isomers, t10c12 caused a greater reduction in mammary ACC activity. Hepatic ACC
      or FAS activity and mRNA abundance were not affected by dietary treatments.
      Feeding TVA, c9t11, or t10c12 reduced mammary stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD)
      mRNA and activity. Reduction was greater due to feeding t10c12 compared with
      c9t11. Hepatic SCD mRNA was not affected by dietary treatments, but both CLA
      isomers depressed hepatic SCD activity. Results indicated that t10c12 is a more
      potent inhibitor of mammary lipogenesis and desaturation than is c9t11. A net
      gain of 77 and 1690 micro g of c9t11 in liver and mammary tissue, respectively,
      was found in the TVA-fed group over the control and SA-fed group. However,
      reduced mammary SCD mRNA or activity due to feeding TVA may indicate a limited
      capacity for desaturation of dietary TVA to c9t11 in vivo.

TI  - Reduced expression of the let-7 microRNAs in human lung cancers in association
      with shortened postoperative survival.
PG  - 3753-6
AB  - In this study, we report for the first time reduced expression of the let-7
      microRNA in human lung cancers. Interestingly, 143 lung cancer cases that had
      undergone potentially curative resection could be classified into two major
      groups according to let-7 expression in unsupervised hierarchical analysis,
      showing significantly shorter survival after potentially curative resection in
      cases with reduced let-7 expression (P = 0.0003). Multivariate COX regression
      analysis showed this prognostic impact to be independent of disease stage (hazard
      ratio = 2.17; P = 0.009). In addition, overexpression of let-7 in A549 lung
      adenocarcinoma cell line inhibited lung cancer cell growth in vitro. This study
      represents the first report of reduced expression of let-7 and the potential
      clinical and biological effects of such a microRNA alteration.

TI  - Identification of kidney mesenchymal genes by a combination of microarray
      analysis and Sall1-GFP knockin mice.
PG  - 547-57
AB  - SALL1, a causative gene for Townes-Brocks syndrome, encodes a zinc finger
      protein, and its mouse homolog (Sall1) is essential for metanephros development, 
      as noted during gene targeting. In the embryonic kidney, Sall1 is expressed
      abundantly in mesenchyme-derived structures from condensed mesenchyme, S-,
      comma-shaped bodies, to renal tubules and podocytes. We generated mice in which a
      green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene was inserted into the Sall1 locus and we
      isolated the GFP-positive population from embryonic kidneys of these mice by
      fluorescein-activated cell sorting. The GFP-positive population indeed expressed 
      mesenchymal genes, while the negative population expressed genes in the ureteric 
      bud. To systematically search for genes expressed in the mesenchyme-derived
      cells, we compared gene expression profiles in the GFP-positive and -negative
      populations using microarray analysis, followed by in situ hybridization. We
      detected many genes known to be important for metanephros development including
      Sall1, GDNF, Raldh2, Pax8 and FoxD1, and genes expressed abundantly in the
      metanephric mesenchyme such as Unc4.1, Six2, Osr-2 and PDGFc. We also found
      groups of genes including SSB-4, Smarcd3, micro-Crystallin, TRB-2, which are not 
      known to be expressed in the metanephric mesenchyme. Therefore a combination of
      microarray technology and Sall1-GFP mice is useful for systematic identification 
      of genes expressed in the developing kidney.

TI  - Use of the tobacco feedback-insensitive anthranilate synthase gene (ASA2) as a
      selectable marker for legume hairy root transformation.
PG  - 104-13
AB  - The feedback-insensitive anthranilate synthase ( ASA2) cDNA--isolated from a
      5-methyltryptophan (5MT)-resistant tobacco cell line--driven by the CaMV 35S
      promoter or 606 bp of the native ASA2 promoter, was introduced into the forage
      legume plant Astragalus sinicus or soybean ( Glycine max), using Agrobacterium
      rhizogenes strains DC-AR2 or K599, respectively. Hairy roots of A. sinicus
      transformed with 35S-ASA2 but not 606- ASA2 could be directly selected using
      20-75 micro M 5MT. ASA2 mRNA was expressed in all A. sinicus lines selected with 
      5MT, but nptII mRNA was expressed only in some lines even though the gene was
      present. Free tryptophan was increased 8- to 26-fold in A. sinicus and 3- to
      6-fold in soybean (selected with kanamycin). An HPLC method was used to measure
      anthranilate synthase (AS) activity since there was a fluorescent compound or
      compounds present in the soybean hairy root extracts. The transformed soybean
      hairy roots contained more feedback-resistant AS activity, showing that there is 
      interaction of the tobacco ASA2 alpha-subunit with the soybean beta-subunit to
      form an active enzyme. Soybean hairy roots that express ASA2 also exhibit 5MT
      resistance. These results demonstrate that the tobacco feedback-insensitive ASA2 
      gene can be used as a selectable marker for transformation of the legume A.
      sinicus.

TI  - The epigenetic stability of the locus control region-deficient IgH locus in mouse
      hybridoma cells is a clonally varying, heritable feature.
PG  - 411-21
AB  - Cis-acting elements such as enhancers and locus control regions (LCRs) prevent
      silencing of gene expression. We have shown previously that targeted deletion of 
      an LCR in the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) locus creates conditions in which 
      the immunoglobulin micro heavy chain gene can exist in either of two
      epigenetically inherited states, one in which micro expression is positive and
      one in which micro expression is negative, and that the positive and negative
      states are maintained by a cis-acting mechanism. As described here, the stability
      of these states, i.e., the propensity of a cell to switch from one state to the
      other, varied among subclones and was an inherited, clonal feature. A similar
      variation in stability was seen for IgH loci that both lacked and retained the
      matrix attachment regions associated with the LCR. Our analysis of cell hybrids
      formed by fusing cells in which the micro expression had different stabilities
      indicated that stability was also determined by a cis-acting feature of the IgH
      locus. Our results thus show that a single-copy gene in the same chromosomal
      location and in the presence of the same transcription factors can exist in many 
      different states of expression.

TI  - Differential involvement of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt in human RPE MCP-1 and 
      IL-8 expression.
PG  - 1887-96
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the role of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)
      pathway and the signal mediator AP-1 in monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and 
      interleukin (IL)-8 gene expression in human retinal pigment epithelial (hRPE)
      cells. METHODS: hRPE cells were stimulated with IL-1beta and TNF-alpha and by
      coculturing with monocytes in the presence or absence of a series of kinase
      inhibitors. The induction of MCP-1 and IL-8 protein and mRNA was determined by
      ELISA and RT-PCR, respectively. Western blot analysis, kinase assays, and
      electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to detect the activation of
      signaling mediators and transcription factors. RESULTS: Concomitant with the
      induction of chemokine expression by the stimuli, there was phosphorylation of
      PI3K and its downstream targets-namely, Akt, GSK, and FKHR. Ly294002, a specific 
      inhibitor of PI3K, resulted in time- and dose-dependent blockade of MCP-1 mRNA
      expression and protein production. The IC(50) for inhibition of MCP-1 secretion
      induced by IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and hRPE-monocyte binding was 16, 12, and less
      than 3 micro M, respectively. In contrast, Ly294002 did not inhibit the IL-8
      expression induced by any of the stimuli. Ly294002 as well as U0126, SB202190,
      and SP600125, the selective inhibitors of MEK, p38, and JNK, respectively,
      strongly inhibited induced c-fos expression, whereas Ly294002 did not inhibit
      induction of MEK, p38, or JNK. Blockade of PI3K/Akt abolished IL-1beta-induced
      nuclear translocation of AP-1, whereas the induction of IkappaB degradation was
      unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: The Ly294002-sensitive PI3K/Akt pathway regulates MCP-1, 
      but not IL-8 expression in hRPE cells independent of MAPK and IkappaB.
      PI3K-dependent induction of hRPE c-fos and AP-1 nuclear translocation may be a
      target for therapies aimed at modulating MCP-1 in retinal diseases.

TI  - Characteristics of RNA silencing in plants: similarities and differences across
      kingdoms.
PG  - 157-74
AB  - RNA silencing is a collective term that encompasses the sequence of events that
      leads to the targeted degradation of cellular mRNA and thus to the silencing of
      corresponding gene expression. RNA silencing is initiated after introduction into
      the host genome of a gene that is homologous to an endogenous gene. Transcription
      of the introduced gene results in the formation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)
      that is cut into smaller dsRNA species termed small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by 
      an RNaseIII-like enzyme called 'Dicer'. siRNAs associate with a protein complex
      termed the 'RNA-induced silencing complex' (RISC), which mediates the binding of 
      one strand of siRNAs with mRNAs transcribed from the native 'target' gene. The
      binding of siRNAs with native gene mRNAs earmarks native gene mRNAs for
      destruction, resulting in gene silencing. In plants, RNA silencing appears to
      serve as a defence mechanism against viral pathogens and also to suppress the
      activity of virus-like mobile genetic elements. In an apparent response to RNA
      silencing, some plant viruses express suppressors of RNA silencing. RNA silencing
      also is directly implicated in the regulation of the function(s) of microRNAs,
      which are the key determinants in an additional cellular mechanism related to the
      translational repression of genes, the effect of which ultimately impinges on
      development. The high degree of sequence similarity that exists between genes
      involved in RNA silencing in widely different organisms underscores the conserved
      nature of many aspects of the RNA silencing mechanism. However, depending (for
      example) on the precise nature of the target gene involved, there also are
      significant differences in the silencing pathways that are engaged by various
      organisms.

TI  - The effects of micro-aeration on the phylogenetic diversity of microorganisms in 
      a thermophilic anaerobic municipal solid-waste digester.
PG  - 2537-50
AB  - We demonstrated previously that micro-aeration allows construction of an
      effective thermophilic methane-fermentation system for treatment of municipal
      solid waste (MSW) without production of H(2)S. In the present study, we compared 
      the microbial communities in a thermophilic MSW digester without aeration and
      with micro-aeration by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), denaturing
      gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), phylogenetic analysis of libraries of 16S
      rRNA gene clones and quantitative real-time PCR. Moreover, we studied the
      activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) by analysis of the transcription of
      the gene for dissimilatory sulfite reductase (dsr). Experiments using FISH
      revealed that microorganisms belonging to the domain Bacteria dominated in the
      digester both without aeration and with micro-aeration. Phylogenetic analysis
      based on 16S rRNA gene and analysis of bacteria by DGGE did not reveal any
      obvious difference within the microbial communities under the two aeration
      conditions, and bacteria affiliated with the phylum Firmicutes were dominant. In 
      Archaea, the population of Methanosarcina decreased while the population of
      Methanoculleus increased as a result of micro-aerations as revealed by the
      analysis of 16S rRNA gene clones and quantitative real-time PCR. Reverse
      transcription and PCR (RT-PCR) demonstrated the transcription of dsrA not only in
      the absence of aeration but also in the presence of micro-aeration, even under
      conditions where no H(2)S was detected in the biogas. In conclusion,
      micro-aeration has no obvious effects on the phylogenetic diversity of
      microorganisms. Furthermore, the activity of SRBs in the digester was not
      repressed even though the concentration of H(2)S in the biogas was very low under
      the micro-aeration conditions.

TI  - Morphine and endomorphin-1 differently influence pronociceptin/orphanin FQ system
      in neuropathic rats.
PG  - 171-8
AB  - In the present study, we investigated the influence of intrathecal (i.t.)
      administration of morphine and endomorphin-1 on the level of
      pronociceptin/orphanin FQ and opioid receptor-like 1 (ORL1) receptor mRNAs in the
      lumbar part of the spinal cord in the rat model of neuropathic pain. The ligation
      of the sciatic nerve did not change the levels of pronociceptin/orphanin FQ and
      ORL1 receptor mRNAs in laminae I-VI of the dorsal horn when measured by in situ
      hybridisation 2 and 7 days after the nerve injury, but ORL1 receptor mRNA level
      in the ventral horn was significantly increased. Two micro-opioid receptor
      agonists, morphine and endomorphin-1, whose effectiveness in neuropathic pain is 
      different, also disparately influenced nociceptin/orphanin FQ system in this pain
      model, inasmuch as an increase in pronociceptin/orphanin FQ and ORL1 receptor
      mRNAs was observed in laminae I-VI after morphine administration (5 microg i.t.) 
      but not after endomorphin-1 treatment (5 microg i.t.). Moreover, the injection of
      ORL1 receptor antagonists (PhePsi; 30 microg i.t.) before morphine potentiated
      the effect of morphine in neuropathic pain model. Therefore, the activation of
      the endogenous nociceptin/orphanin FQ system, which is known to exhibit
      antiopioidergic activity, apart from its analgesic action, could be the reason
      for lower responsiveness to morphine in neuropathic pain.

AB  - Plasmids expressing the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) latency-associated
      transcript (LAT) reduce apoptosis in transient transfection assays in tissue
      culture. LAT also reduces apoptosis in the context of the virus in trigeminal
      ganglia of rabbits and mice at approximately 6-7 days post-infection during the
      switch from acute to latent HSV-1 infection, a time at which LAT is the only
      abundantly transcribed viral gene. Analysis of LAT's anti-apoptosis function is
      complicated in tissue culture by the expression of at least five additional viral
      gene products that can block apoptosis, and by the fact that apoptosis usually
      occurs in only a fraction of the cells. Here, we present two approaches for
      detecting LAT's anti-apoptosis activity in the context of the whole virus in
      tissue culture. Using a combination of serum starvation to both partially
      synchronize the cells and induce apoptosis, and Hoechst staining to detect
      chromatin condensation, we found that there was a small window of time
      post-infection during which Schwann cells infected with the LAT(-) mutant
      dLAT2903 reproducibly had more apoptotic nuclei than identically treated cells
      infected with the LAT(+) parental virus HSV-1 strain McKrae. Using serum
      starvation and/or UV treatment and a method to isolate fragmented DNA away from
      large chromosomal DNA, we found a similar window of time post-infection during
      which Neuro2A cells infected with dLAT2903 had increased DNA fragmentation (as
      judged by a DNA laddering assay) compared to identically treated cells infected
      with wild type McKrae or the LAT(+) marker rescued dLAT2903R virus. These assays 
      should permit the use of culture assays, rather than labor intensive animal
      models, to examine LAT's anti-apoptosis activity in the context of the virus in a
      large number of existing LAT mutant viruses.

AB  - To study the effect of VEGF fully phosporothioated antisense oligodeoxynucleotide
      (VEGF-ASODN) on VEGF expression in acute monocyte leukemic cell line U937 in
      vitro, U937 cells were incubated with VEGF-ASODN at concentrations of 10, 20 and 
      30 micro mol/L or scrambled sequence as compared with negative control. The
      expression of VEGF mRNA was measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The expression 
      of VEGF protein was measured by Western blot. The result showed that VEGF-ASODN
      had obviously inhibitive effect on expression of VEGF in U937 cell, as compared
      with scrambled sequence and negative control (P < 0.05). Scrambled sequence group
      had no significant difference compared with negative control group (P > 0.05). It
      is concluded that the expressions of VEGF mRNA and protein in leukemic cell line 
      U937 are down-regulated by VEGF-ASODN.

TI  - Maintenance of glucose-sensitive insulin secretion of cryopreserved human islets 
      with University of Wisconsin solution and ascorbic acid-2 glucoside.
PG  - 529-36
AB  - Normal human islet cells are an ideal source for pancreas-targeted cell
      therapies, but the availability of human donor pancreata for islet isolation is
      severely limited. To effectively utilize such scarce donor organs for cell
      therapies, it is crucial to develop an excellent isolation, effective
      cryopreservation, and efficient gene transfer techniques for the transportation
      of isolated cells. In the present study, we investigate the effect of University 
      of Wisconsin (UW) solution and ascorbic acid-2 glucoside (AA2G) on the
      cryopreservation of human islets. We also evaluate the gene transfer efficiency
      of a lentiviral vector expressing the E. coli LacZ gene, Lt-NLS/LacZ, in human
      islets. Human islets were isolated with a standard digestion method at the
      University of Alberta. Isolated islets were transported to Japan for 40 h and
      then subjected to cryopreservation experiments. The following preservation
      solutions were tested: UW solution with 100 micro g/mL of AA2G, UW solution, 100%
      fetal bovine serum (FBS), and CMRL supplemented with 10% FBS. Following three
      months of cryopreservation, the islets were thawed and analyzed for viability,
      glucose-sensitive insulin secretion, proinsulin gene expression profile, and in
      vivo engraftment. The islets were also subjected to monolayer formation with
      804G-cell-line-derived extracellular matrix (ECM), followed by Lt-NLS/LacZ
      transduction. The viability, morphology, glucose-sensitive insulin secretion,
      proinsulin gene expression, and monolayer formation efficiency of the thawed
      cryopreserved islets are significantly better maintained by the use of UW
      solution. When AA2G (100 microg/mL) is combined with UW, such parameters are
      further improved. The adequate engraftment of UW + AA2G-cryopreserved human
      islets is achieved in the liver of nude mice. Efficient Lt-NLS/LacZ transduction 
      is identified in monolayered islets cryopreserved with UW solution with AA2G. The
      present work demonstrates that the combination of UW solution with AA2G (100
      microg/mL) would be a useful cryopreservation means for human islets. Human
      islets monolayer-cultured with 804G-derived ECM are efficiently transduced with a
      lentiviral vector Lt-NLS/LacZ.

TI  - miRNAs on the move: miRNA biogenesis and the RNAi machinery.
PG  - 223-9
AB  - Recent advances have led to a more detailed understanding of RNA interference and
      its role in microRNA biogenesis and function. Primary microRNA transcripts are
      processed by the RNaseIII nuclease, Drosha, and are exported from the nucleus by 
      Exportin-5. Dicer cleaves microRNAs into their mature forms, which can be
      incorporated into effector complexes that mediate gene silencing activities. The 
      3' two-nucleotide overhang structure, a signature of RNaseIII cleavage, has been 
      identified as a critical specificity determinant in targeting and maintaining
      small RNAs in the RNA interference pathway. MicroRNA functional analyses and
      genetic and biochemical interrogation of components of the pathway are starting
      to provide a glimpse at the range of biological processes and phenomena regulated
      by RNA interference.

TI  - [Effects of meisoindigo on the expression of globin gene in vitro].
PG  - 184-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The pathophysiology of beta-thalassemia is the imbalance of the alpha 
      and non-alpha globin chain which leads to a series of clinical symptoms of
      hemolytic anemia. Scientists continuously try to explore gene-activated drugs to 
      increase the level of non-alpha globin chain or decrease the level of alpha
      globin chain in the treatment of beta-thalassemia. To probe into the effects on
      globin-gene expression of meisoindigo (Me) in cultured erythroid cells derived
      from peripheral blood, so as to provide the theoretical basis for applying Me in 
      the treatment of beta-thalassemia. METHODS: By using the two-step liquid culture 
      of erythroid progenitor cells and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
      (RT-PCR), and by using alpha mRNA as an inner control, the level of gamma mRNA
      and beta mRNA in cultured erythroid cells derived from peripheral blood of 11
      patients with severe beta-thalassemia and 6 normal volunteers were measured under
      the effect of different concentration (2.5 micro mol/L, 5 micro mol/L and 10
      micro mol/L) of Me. RESULTS: (1) No statistic significance was found in the ratio
      of beta/alpha mRNA by Me in cultured cells from both normal individuals and
      beta-thalassemia. (2) Me can significantly increase the ratio of gamma/alpha mRNA
      and (beta + gamma)/alpha mRNA (that is non-alpha/alpha mRNA) in cultured cells
      from normal individuals and beta-thalassemia. The ratio of gamma/alpha mRNA was
      increased 0.31 - 0.45 times and the ratio of non-alpha mRNA/alpha mRNA increased 
      0.21 - 0.32 times in Me induced cells from normal individuals. No significant
      result was observed among the different concentrations of Me (2.5 micro mol/L, 5 
      micro mol/L and 10 micro mol/L) in normal individuals. With the increasing of Me 
      concentrations, the ratios of gamma/alpha mRNA and alpha/alpha mRNA were
      increased in cultured cells from beta-thalassemia. The ratio of gamma/alpha mRNA 
      was increased 0.33 - 1.17 times and the ratio of non-alpha/alpha mRNA increased
      0.25 - 0.89 times in Me induced cells from beta-thalassemia. There was no
      significant difference between the concentrations of 2.5 micro mol/L and 5 micro 
      mol/L concentration in beta-thalassemia. However, there was significant
      difference between the concentrations of 10 micro mol/L and the concentrations of
      2.5 micro mol/L and 5 micro mol/L in beta-thalassemia. (3) The increase of the
      ratio of gamma/alpha mRNA and non-alpha/alpha mRNA in beta-thalassemia was higher
      than that in normal individual with induction by Me with a higher concentration
      (10 micro mol/L). CONCLUSION: Me can raise the ratio of gamma/alpha mRNA and
      non-alpha/alpha mRNA in cultured erythroid cells derived from peripheral blood of
      both normal individual and beta-thalassemia in the level of transcription, which 
      can improve the imbalance of the alpha and non-alpha globin chain. So Me has a
      latent value in the therapy of beta-thalassemia.

PG  - 362-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential molecular mechanism underlying
      down-regulation of albumin expression induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rat 
      hepatocytes. METHODS: The albumin mRNA expression and albumin protein levels in
      the supernatant were observed at 0, 2, 8, 12 and 24 hours after 1 micro g/ml LPS 
      treatment. The albumin mRNA expression was determined by RT-PCR, and albumin
      protein levels were assayed with EIA in the supernatant of hepatocytes pretreated
      with specific inhibitors of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (PD98059) and
      p38 kinase (SB203580). RESULTS: The albumin mRNA expression was reduced to 70% of
      baseline value, meanwhile, the albumin protein concentration in the supernatant
      was reduced by 50% compared with the controls after 24 hours of LPS treatment.
      Pretreatment with PD98059 and SB203580 did significantly inhibit the reduction of
      albumin by LPS at the given dose. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that LPS can
      induce the reduction of albumin synthesis by down-regulation of albumin mRNA
      expression at transcription level, and the process may be related to the signal
      transducation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 kinase.

TI  - Catellibacterium nectariphilum gen. nov., sp. nov., which requires a diffusible
      compound from a strain related to the genus Sphingomonas for vigorous growth.
PG  - 955-9
AB  - A bacterial strain, designated AST4(T), was isolated from activated sludge. The
      bacterium did not show significant growth on nutrient broth, but growth was
      clearly stimulated by addition of supernatant from other bacterial cultures.
      Culture filtrate of a strain related to the genus Sphingomonas in particular
      increased the cell yield and growth rate of strain AST4(T). Phylogenetic analysis
      based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain AST4(T) is located within
      the 'Rhodobacter group' in the alpha-3 subclass of Proteobacteria, but is clearly
      distant from related genera in this group such as Paracoccus, Rhodobacter and
      Rhodovulum. Strain AST4(T) is a Gram-negative, non-motile, rod-shaped
      (0.6-0.8x1.3-2.0 micro m) and aerobic bacterium. It was not able to reduce
      nitrate to nitrite or N(2). No phototrophic growth was observed. Optimal growth
      occurred at 30 degrees C and pH 6.5-7.5. The dominant cellular fatty acid in the 
      isolate was C(18 : 1)cis11. Ubiquinone-10 was the major respiratory quinone. The 
      G+C content was 64.5 mol% (by HPLC). Based on the phylogenetic and phenotypic
      traits, the name Catellibacterium nectariphilum gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed
      for this isolate; the type strain is AST4(T) (=NBRC 100046(T)=JCM 11959(T)=DSM
      15620(T)).

TI  - The genus Spiroplasma and its non-helical descendants: phylogenetic
      classification, correlation with phenotype and roots of the Mycoplasma mycoides
      clade.
PG  - 893-918
AB  - The genus Spiroplasma (helical mollicutes: Bacteria: Firmicutes: Mollicutes:
      Entomoplasmatales: Spiroplasmataceae) is associated primarily with insects. The
      Mycoplasma mycoides cluster (sensu Weisburg et al. 1989 and Johansson and
      Pettersson 2002) is a group of mollicutes that includes the type species -
      Mycoplasma mycoides - of Mycoplasmatales, Mycoplasmataceae and Mycoplasma. This
      cluster, associated solely with ruminants, contains five other species and
      subspecies. Earlier phylogenetic reconstructions based on partial 16S rDNA
      sequences and a limited sample of Spiroplasma and Mycoplasma sequences suggested 
      that the genus Mycoplasma was polyphyletic, as the M. mycoides cluster and the
      grouping that consisted of the hominis and pneumoniae groups of Mycoplasma
      species were widely separated phylogenetically and the M. mycoides cluster was
      allied with Spiroplasma. It is shown here that the M. mycoides cluster arose from
      Spiroplasma through an intermediate group of non-helical spiroplasmal descendants
      - the Entomoplasmataceae. As this conclusion has profound implications in the
      taxonomy of Mollicutes, a detailed phylogenetic study of Spiroplasma and its
      non-helical descendants was undertaken. These analyses, done with
      maximum-parsimony, provide cladistic status; a new nomenclature is introduced
      here, based on 'bottom-up' rather than 'top-down' clade classification. The order
      Entomoplasmatales consists of four major clades: (i) the
      Mycoides-Entomoplasmataceae clade, which contains M. mycoides and its allies and 
      Entomoplasma and Mesoplasma species and is a sister lineage to (ii) the Apis
      clade of Spiroplasma. Spiroplasma and the Entomoplasmataceae are paraphyletic,
      but this status does not diminish their phylogenetic usefulness. Five species
      that were previously unclassified phylogenetically are basal to the Apis clade
      sensu strictu and to the Mycoides clade. One of these species, Spiroplasma sp.
      TIUS-1, has very poor helicity and a very small genome (840 kbp); this putative
      species can be envisioned as a 'missing link' in the evolution of the
      Mycoides-Entomoplasmataceae clade. The other two Spiroplasma clades are: (iii)
      the Citri-Chrysopicola-Mirum clade (serogroups I, II, V and VIII) and (iv) the
      ixodetis clade (serogroup VI). As Mesoplasma lactucae represents a basal
      divergence within the Mycoides-Entomoplasmataceae clade, and as Entomoplasma
      freundtii is basal to the Mycoides clade, M. mycoides and its allies must have
      arisen from an ancestor in the Entomoplasmataceae. The paraphyletic grouping that
      consists of the Hominis and Pneumoniae groups (sensu Johansson & Pettersson 2002)
      of Mycoplasma species contains the ancestral roots of Ureaplasma spp. and
      haemoplasmas. This clade is a sister lineage to the Entomoplasmatales clade.
      Serological classifications of spiroplasma are very highly supported by the trees
      presented. Genome size and G+C content of micro-organismal DNA were moderately
      conserved, but there have been frequent and polyphyletically distributed genome
      reductions. Sterol requirements were polyphyletic, as was the ability to grow in 
      the presence of polyoxyethylene sorbitan-supplemented, but not
      serum-supplemented, media. As this character is not phylogenetically distributed,
      Mesoplasma and Entomoplasma should be combined into a single genus. The
      phylogenetic trees presented here confirm previous reports of polyphyly of the
      genus Mycoplasma. As both clades of Mycoplasma contain several species of great
      practical importance, a change of the genus name for species in either clade
      would have immense practical implications. In addition, a change of the genus
      name for M. mycoides would have to be approved by the Judicial Commission. For
      these reasons, the Linnaean and phylogenetic classifications of Mycoplasma must
      for now be discrepant.

TI  - Methanobacterium aarhusense sp. nov., a novel methanogen isolated from a marine
      sediment (Aarhus Bay, Denmark).
PG  - 759-63
AB  - Strain H2-LR(T), a 5-18 micro m long and 0.7 micro m wide filamentous,
      mesophilic, moderately halophilic, non-motile hydrogenotrophic methanogen, was
      isolated from marine sediment of Aarhus Bay, Denmark, 1.7 m below the sediment
      surface. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene comparison with sequences of known
      methanogens, strain H2-LR(T) could be affiliated to the genus Methanobacterium.
      The strain forms a distinct line of descent within this genus, with
      Methanobacterium oryzae (95.9 % sequence identity) and Methanobacterium bryantii 
      (95.7 % sequence identity) as its closest relatives. The 16S rRNA-based
      affiliation was supported by comparison of the mcrA gene, which encodes the
      alpha-subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase. Strain H2-LR(T) grew only on
      H(2)/CO(2). The DNA G+C content is 34.9 mol%. Optimum growth temperature was 45
      degrees C. The strain grew equally well at pH 7.5 and 8. No growth or methane
      production was observed below pH 5 or above pH 9. Strain H2-LR(T) grew well
      within an NaCl concentration range of 100 and 900 mM. No growth or methane
      production was observed at 1 M NaCl. At 50 mM NaCl, growth and methane production
      were reduced. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the isolate is proposed
      to represent a novel taxon within the genus Methanobacterium, namely
      Methanobacterium aarhusense sp. nov. The type strain is H2-LR(T) (=DSM
      15219(T)=ATCC BAA-828(T)).

TI  - Cloning and expression of a novel esterase gene cpoA from Burkholderia cepacia.
PG  - 1306-16
AB  - AIMS: To screen and clone a novel enzyme with specific activity for the
      resolution of (R)-beta-acetylmercaptoisobutyrate (RAM) from
      (R,S)-beta-acetylmercaptoisobutyrate [(R,S)-ester]. METHODS AND RESULTS: A
      micro-organism that produces a novel esterase was isolated and identified as the 
      bacterium Burkholderia cepacia by using the analysis of cellular fatty acids,
      Biolog automated microbial identification/characterization system, and 16S rRNA
      gene sequence analysis. A novel esterase gene was cloned from the chromosomal DNA
      of B. cepacia and was designated as cpoA. The cpoA encodes a polypeptide of 273
      amino acids which shows a strong sequence homology with many bacterial nonhaeme
      chloroperoxidases. In addition, a typical serine-hydrolase motif,
      Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly, and the highly conserved catalytic triad, Ser95, Asp224, and
      His253, were identified in the deduced amino acid sequence of cpoA by multiple
      sequence alignment. CONCLUSION: The cpoA cloned from B. cepacia encodes a novel
      esterase which is highly related to the nonhaeme chloroperoxidases. SIGNIFICANCE 
      AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report that describes the isolation
      and cloning of a serine esterase gene from B. cepacia, which is useful in the
      chiral resolution of (R,S)-ester. The cloned gene will allow additional research 
      on the bifunctionality of the enzyme with esterase and chloroperoxidase activity 
      at the structural and functional levels.

TI  - A role for protease-activated receptor-2 in pancreatic cancer cell proliferation.
PG  - 1401-6
AB  - The protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) is a G protein-coupled receptor that is
      cleaved and activated by trypsin and tryptase. The purpose of this study was to
      clarify the role of PAR-2 in proliferation of human pancreatic cancer cells.
      PAR-2 mRNA and protein expression were detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting in
      three cell lines, SW1990, Capan-2, and Panc-1. The PAR-2 agonist peptide, SLIGKV 
      (25, 50 micro g/ml) and trypsin (10, 100 ng/ml) significantly increased cell
      proliferation. Enhancement of MAP kinase also was observed in cancer cells
      treated with SLIGKV and trypsin. In vivo, subcutaneous xenografted tumors showed 
      significantly enhanced growth after treatment with SLIGKV. Tumor-associated
      trypsinogen (TAT) mRNA and protein expression was detected in SW1990 and Capan-2,
      suggesting autocrine trypsin production. PAR-2 activated by trypsin plays an
      important role in promoting proliferation of pancreatic cancer.

TI  - Widespread distribution of antisense transcripts in the Plasmodium falciparum
      genome.
PG  - 35-42
AB  - The availability of the complete genome sequence of Plasmodium falciparum has
      facilitated high-throughput profiling of its complex life cycle, following the
      application of micro-array, proteomic, and serial analysis of gene expression
      (SAGE) technologies in this system. These, in turn, have yielded unprecedented
      insight into global gene expression, including the foremost demonstration of
      antisense transcription in the parasite. For example, owing to its inherent
      ability to sample novel ORFs and to predict transcript orientation, SAGE analysis
      in asexual forms led to the initial discovery of highly abundant antisense RNAs. 
      To determine the extent of this phenomenon in P. falciparum, we have surveyed the
      distribution of both sense and antisense transcripts across the asexual
      transcriptome for the first time. To this end, a relational database integrating 
      SAGE expression data with genome annotation information was constructed. This
      allowed the comprehensive annotation of a total of 17245 SAGE tags, extending
      over a 350-fold expression range. Transcripts from approximately 30% of the
      estimated 3D7 gene loci were present at detectable levels in mixed asexual
      stages, where loci involved in invasion and immune evasion; and carbohydrate
      metabolism were highly represented in the sense transcriptome. Approximately 12% 
      of SAGE tags, however, were derived from the non-coding strand of nuclear-encoded
      ORFs, indicating that endogenous antisense RNAs are widespread in this system.
      Notably, these antisense transcripts were absent from the mitochondrial genome.
      Interestingly, we note that sense and antisense tag counts from single loci
      across the transcriptome were inversely related. Taken together, this data may
      provide first hints as to the possible function of antisense transcription in
      this system.

TI  - Molecular evolution of a microRNA cluster.
PG  - 327-35
AB  - Many of the known microRNAs are encoded in polycistronic transcripts. Here, we
      reconstruct the evolutionary history of the mir17 microRNA clusters which consist
      of miR-17, miR-18, miR-19a, miR-19b, miR-20, miR-25, miR-92, miR-93, miR-106a,
      and miR-106b. The history of this cluster is governed by an initial phase of
      local (tandem) duplications, a series of duplications of entire clusters and
      subsequent loss of individual microRNAs from the resulting paralogous clusters.
      The complex history of the mir17 microRNA family appears to be closely linked to 
      the early evolution of the vertebrate lineage.

PG  - 156-9
AB  - The discovery of microRNSs (miRNAs) has changed the paradigm of gene regulation, 
      leaving us with numerous exciting questions regarding what these molecules do and
      how they originate. A model for miRNA biogenesis has emerged recently, yet
      several key factors--including the identity of the miRNA nuclear export
      receptor--remained unknown. However, recent studies have shown that exportin-5
      (Exp5), a Ran-dependent importin-beta-related transport receptor, mediates
      nuclear export of miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs).

TI  - A combined computational-experimental approach predicts human microRNA targets.
PG  - 1165-78
AB  - A new paradigm of gene expression regulation has emerged recently with the
      discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs). Most, if not all, miRNAs are thought to control 
      gene expression, mostly by base pairing with miRNA-recognition elements (MREs)
      found in their messenger RNA (mRNA) targets. Although a large number of human
      miRNAs have been reported, many of their mRNA targets remain unknown. Here we
      used a combined bioinformatics and experimental approach to identify important
      rules governing miRNA-MRE recognition that allow prediction of human miRNA
      targets. We describe a computational program, "DIANA-microT", that identifies
      mRNA targets for animal miRNAs and predicts mRNA targets, bearing single MREs,
      for human and mouse miRNAs.

TI  - Viral RNA silencing suppressors inhibit the microRNA pathway at an intermediate
      step.
PG  - 1179-86
AB  - RNA silencing suppressors from different plant viruses are structurally diverse. 
      In addition to inhibiting the antiviral silencing response to condition
      susceptibility, many suppressors are pathogenicity factors that cause disease or 
      developmental abnormalities. Here, unrelated suppressors from multiple viruses
      were shown to inhibit microRNA (miRNA) activities and trigger an overlapping
      series of severe developmental defects in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana. This
      suggests that interference with miRNA-directed processes may be a general feature
      contributing to pathogenicity of many viruses. A normally labile intermediate in 
      the miRNA biogenesis/RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) assembly pathway,
      miRNA*, accumulated specifically in the presence of suppressors (P1/HC-Pro, p21, 
      or p19) that inhibited miRNA-guided cleavage of target mRNAs. Both p21 and p19,
      but not P1/HC-Pro, interacted with miRNA/miRNA* complexes and hairpin RNA-derived
      short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in vivo. In addition, p21 bound to synthetic
      miRNA/miRNA* and siRNA duplexes in vitro. We propose that several different
      suppressors act by distinct mechanisms to inhibit the incorporation of small RNAs
      into active RISCs.

TI  - The action of ARGONAUTE1 in the miRNA pathway and its regulation by the miRNA
      pathway are crucial for plant development.
PG  - 1187-97
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous 21-24-nt RNAs that can down-regulate gene
      expression by pairing to the messages of protein-coding genes to specify mRNA
      cleavage or repression of productive translation. They act within the RNA-induced
      silencing complex (RISC), which in animals contains a member of the Argonaute
      family of proteins. In the present study, we show that Arabidopsis ago1 mutants
      have increased accumulation of mRNAs known to be targeted for cleavage by miRNAs.
      In hypomorphic ago1 alleles, this compromised miRNA function occurs without a
      substantial change in miRNA accumulation, whereas in null alleles it is
      accompanied by a drop in some of the miRNAs. Therefore, AGO1 acts within the
      Arabidopsis miRNA pathway, probably within the miRNA-programmed RISC, such that
      the absence of AGO1 destabilizes some of the miRNAs. We also show that targeting 
      of AGO1 mRNA by miR168 is needed for proper plant development, illustrating the
      importance of feedback control by this miRNA. Transgenic plants expressing a
      mutant AGO1 mRNA with decreased complementarity to miR168 overaccumulate AGO1
      mRNA and exhibit developmental defects partially overlapping with those of dcl1, 
      hen1, and hyl1 mutants showing a decrease in miRNA accumulation. miRNA targets
      overaccumulate in miR168-resistant plants, suggesting that a large excess of AGO1
      protein interferes with the function of RISC or sequesters miRNAs or other RISC
      components. Developmental defects induced by a miR168-resistant AGO1 mRNA can be 
      rescued by a compensatory miRNA that is complementary to the mutant AGO1 mRNA,
      proving the regulatory relationship between miR168 and its target and opening the
      way for engineering artificial miRNAs in plants.

TI  - [Hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha regulates vascular endothelial growth factor's
      roles on pulmonary arteries of rats with hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension].
PG  - 174-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the dynamic expression of hypoxia inducible factor
      1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in pulmonary
      arteries of rats with hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. METHODS: Forty male
      adult Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups: a control group (C
      group) and groups with hypoxia for 3, 7, 14 and 21 days (H(3), H(7), H(14) and
      H(21) group), eight rats per group. Mean pulmonary pressure (mPAP), vessel
      morphometry and right ventricle hypertrophy index (RVHI) were measured. Lungs
      were inflation fixed for in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS:
      mPAP increased significantly after 7-day of hypoxia [(18.41 +/- 0.37) mm Hg, P < 
      0.05], reaching its peak after 14-day of hypoxia, then remained on the high
      level. Pulmonary artery remodeling index (outer diameter 100 - 150 micro m) and
      RVHI became evident after 14-day of hypoxia. Expression of HIF-1alpha protein in 
      control group was poorly positive, but was up-regulated in pulmonary arterial
      tunica intima of all hypoxic rats. In pulmonary arterial tunica media, the levels
      of HIF-1alpha protein was markedly up-regulated after 3-day (0.178 +/- 0.017, P <
      0.05), reaching its peak after 7-day of hypoxia (0.221 +/- 0.021, P < 0.05), then
      tended to decline after 14-day and 21-day of hypoxia. HIF-1alpha mRNA staining
      was poorly positive in control, hypoxia for 3 days and hypoxia for 7 days, but
      began to increase significantly after 14-day of hypoxia (0.203 +/- 0.024, P <
      0.05), then remained stable. Expression of VEGF protein began to increase after
      7-day of hypoxia (0.074 +/- 0.022, P < 0.05), reaching its peak after 14-day of
      hypoxia (0.147 +/- 0.017, P < 0.05), then remained on the high level. VEGF mRNA
      in control and hypoxia for 3 days was poorly positive, but began to increase
      after 7-day of hypoxia (0.138 +/- 0.010, P < 0.05), and remained on the high
      level thereafter. VEGF mRNA located mainly in tunica intima and tunica media,
      whereas VEGF protein located predominantly in tunica intima. Linear correlation
      analysis showed that HIF-1alpha mRNA, VEGF, and mPAP were correlated with vessel 
      morphometry and RVHI (P < 0.01). HIF-1alpha protein (tunica intima) was
      positively correlated with VEGF mRNA and protein (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS:
      HIF-1alpha and VEGF are both involved in the pathogenesis of hypoxia-induced
      pulmonary hypertension in rats. HIF-1alpha protein may regulate the expression of
      VEGF gene by transcriptional activation, resulting in the occurrence and
      development of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence and mechanism of peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) and its ligand agonist
      rosiglitazone on airway inflammation of guinea pigs with asthma. METHODS: 35
      guinea pigs were divided into 5 groups by random number meter: a control group (A
      group), an asthma group (B group), a dexamethasone (DXM) group (C group), a
      rosiglitazone group (D group), and a rosiglitazone + 1/2 DXM group (E group),
      with 7 guinea pigs in each. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell count and
      differential was studied, and the pathologic alteration of the bronchi and the
      lung tissue was observed. The expression of PPAR-gamma, COX-2 was measured by
      RT-PCR. RESULTS: BAL eosinophil count was 0.050 +/- 0.020 in D group, 0.110 +/-
      0.020 in B group, the difference being significantly (t = 5.61, P < 0.001). The
      total cell number and neutrophils were (15.5 +/- 3.9) x 10(8)/L and 0.069 +/-
      0.020 in D group, and (19.9 +/- 4.3) x 10(8)/L and 0.076 +/- 0.020 in B group,
      the difference being not significant (t = 2.02, 0.66, P > 0.05 respectively). The
      thickness of airway wall of D group was (22.0 +/- 5.0) micro m, and in B group it
      was (28.0 +/- 5.0) micro m, the difference being significant (t = 2.61, P <
      0.05), but the thickness of mucosa and submucosa of D group (12.2 +/- 2.9) micro 
      m was not different as compared with B group (14.9 +/- 3.3) micro m (t = 1.63, P 
      > 0.05). Expression of PPAR-gamma mRNA of D group 19.5 +/- 3.0 was not different 
      compared with B group 18.1 +/- 3.1 and A group 15.6 +/- 2.9 respectively (t =
      0.92, 0.49, P > 0.05, respectively). When the expression of COX-2 mRNA of B group
      49 +/- 7 was compared with D group 39 +/- 6, the difference was significant (t = 
      2.77, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Rosiglitazone decreases airway eosinophils and the 
      thickness of airway wall in guinea pigs with asthma, via suppression of COX-2
      mRNA expression by activating PPAR-gamma. The anti-inflammatory effect of
      PPAR-gamma may be associated with the use of ligand agonist and(or)
      glucocorticoids.

TI  - IgA class switch occurs in the organized nasopharynx- and gut-associated lymphoid
      tissue, but not in the diffuse lamina propria of airways and gut.
PG  - 6259-64
AB  - Secretory IgA plays a crucial role in the host immune response as a first line of
      defense. A recent demonstration of in situ IgA class switching in intestinal
      lamina propria provided an opportunity to reconsider the model for the homing of 
      IgA-committed B cells characterized by distinctive trafficking patterns to
      effector sites. Those effector sites depend on the organized mucosa-associated
      lymphoid tissues as their site of induction. In this report we show the
      preferential presence of IgM(+)B220(+) and IgA(+)B220(+) cells belonging to pre- 
      and post-IgA isotype class-switched cells in the organized mucosa-associated
      lymphoid tissues, such as nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissues, isolated
      lymphoid follicles, and Peyer's patches, and the defect of those populations in
      the diffuse effector tissues, such as the nasal passage and intestinal lamina
      propria. Consistent with these findings, the expressions of a series of IgA
      isotype class switch recombination-related molecules, including
      activation-induced cytidine deaminase, Ialpha-C micro circle transcripts, and
      Ialpha-C micro circle transcripts, were selectively detected in these organized
      mucosa-associated lymphoid structures, but not in the diffuse mucosal effector
      sites. Taken together, these findings suggest that IgA isotype class switching
      occurs only in the organized mucosa-associated lymphoid organs (e.g.,
      nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissues, isolated lymphoid follicles, and Peyer's
      patches), but not in the diffuse effector tissues of the upper respiratory and
      gastrointestinal tracts.

TI  - Isolation, characterization, and in situ detection of a novel
      chemolithoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bacterium in wastewater biofilms growing
      under microaerophilic conditions.
PG  - 3122-9
AB  - We successfully isolated a novel aerobic chemolithotrophic sulfur-oxidizing
      bacterium, designated strain SO07, from wastewater biofilms growing under
      microaerophilic conditions. For isolation, the use of elemental sulfur (S(0)),
      which is the most abundant sulfur pool in the wastewater biofilms, as the
      electron donor was an effective measure to establish an enrichment culture of
      strain SO07 and further isolation. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that 
      newly isolated strain SO07 was affiliated with members of the genus
      Halothiobacillus, but it was only distantly related to previously isolated
      species (89% identity). Strain SO07 oxidized elemental sulfur, thiosulfate, and
      sulfide to sulfate under oxic conditions. Strain SO07 could not grow on nitrate. 
      Organic carbons, including acetate, propionate, and formate, could not serve as
      carbon and energy sources. Unlike other aerobic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, this
      bacterium was sensitive to NaCl; growth in medium containing more than 150 mM was
      negligible. In situ hybridization combined with confocal laser scanning
      microscopy revealed that a number of rod-shaped cells hybridized with a probe
      specific for strain SO07 were mainly present in the oxic biofilm strata (ca. 0 to
      100 micro m) and that they often coexisted with sulfate-reducing bacteria in this
      zone. These results demonstrated that strain SO07 was one of the important
      sulfur-oxidizing populations involved in the sulfur cycle occurring in the
      wastewater biofilm and was primarily responsible for the oxidation of H(2)S and
      S(0) to SO(4)(2-) under oxic conditions.

      anaerobic, acid-resistant Bacterium from Low-pH, nitrate- and U(VI)-contaminated 
      subsurface sediment and description of Salmonella subterranea sp. nov.
PG  - 2959-65
AB  - A facultatively anaerobic, acid-resistant bacterium, designated strain FRCl, was 
      isolated from a low-pH, nitrate- and U(VI)-contaminated subsurface sediment at
      site FW-024 at the Natural and Accelerated Bioremediation Research Field Research
      Center in Oak Ridge, Tenn. Strain FRCl was enriched at pH 4.5 in minimal medium
      with nitrate as the electron acceptor, hydrogen as the electron donor, and
      acetate as the carbon source. Clones with 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences
      identical to the sequence of strain FRCl were also detected in a U(VI)-reducing
      enrichment culture derived from the same sediment. Cells of strain FRCl were
      gram-negative motile regular rods 2.0 to 3.4 micro m long and 0.7 to 0.9 microm
      in diameter. Strain FRCl was positive for indole production, by the methyl red
      test, and for ornithine decarboxylase; it was negative by the Voges-Proskauer
      test (for acetylmethylcarbinol production), for urea hydrolysis, for arginine
      dihydrolase, for lysine decarboxylase, for phenylalanine deaminase, for H(2)S
      production, and for gelatin hydrolysis. Strain FRCl was capable of using O(2),
      NO(3)(-), S(2)O(3)(2-), fumarate, and malate as terminal electron acceptors and
      of reducing U(VI) in the cell suspension. Analysis of the 16S rDNA sequence of
      the isolate indicated that this strain was 96.4% similar to Salmonella bongori
      and 96.3% similar to Enterobacter cloacae. Physiological and phylogenetic
      analyses suggested that strain FRCl belongs to the genus Salmonella and
      represents a new species, Salmonella subterranea sp. nov.

TI  - Genistein enhances insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway in human breast
      cancer (MCF-7) cells.
PG  - 2351-9
AB  - Physiological concentration of genistein, a natural isoflavonoid phytoestrogen,
      stimulates human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells proliferation. In this study, we
      hypothesize that low concentration of genistein mimics the action of
      17beta-estradiol in stimulation of MCF-7 cell growth by enhancement of IGF-I
      signaling pathway. Genistein, at 1 microM, stimulated the growth of MCF-7 cells. 
      Cell cycle analysis showed that 1 micro M genistein significantly increased the S
      phase and decreased the G0G1 phase of MCF-7 cells. The protein and mRNA
      expression of IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, but
      not Src homology/collagen protein, increased in response to 1 microM genistein in
      a time-dependent manner. These effects could be completely abolished by
      cotreatment of MCF-7 cells with estrogen antagonist ICI 182780 (1 microM) and
      tamoxifen (0.1 microM). Our results also showed that genistein induction of
      IGF-IR and IRS-1 expression resulted in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of
      IGF-IR and IRS-1 on IGF-I stimulation. Taken together, these data provide the
      first evidence that the IGF-IR pathway is involved in the proliferative effect of
      low-dose genistein in MCF-7 cells.

TI  - Identification and characterization of a novel gene, C13orf25, as a target for
      13q31-q32 amplification in malignant lymphoma.
PG  - 3087-95
AB  - The amplification at 13q31-q32 has been reported in not only hematopoietic
      malignancies but also in other solid tumors. We identified previously frequent
      amplification of chromosomal band 13q31-q32 in 70 cases of diffuse large B-cell
      lymphoma patients by conventional comparative genomic hybridization analysis. In 
      an attempt to identify a candidate gene within this region, we used array
      comparative genomic hybridization and fluorescent in situ hybridization to map
      the 13q31-q32 amplicon. We then screened the 65 expressed sequence tags and
      Glypican 5 (GPC5) by reverse transcription-PCR and Northern blotting. As a
      result, we identified a novel gene, designated Chromosome 13 open reading frame
      25 (C13orf25), which was overexpressed in B-cell lymphoma cell lines and diffuse 
      large B-cell lymphoma patients with 13q31-q32 amplifications. However, GPC5,
      which has been reported to be a target gene for 13q31-q32 amplification, was
      truncated in one cell line, Rec1, possessing the amplification, and its
      expression in various cell lines with amplification at 13q31-q32 was not
      significantly different from that in other cell lines without amplification,
      suggesting that GPC5 is not likely to be the candidate gene. Additional analysis 
      identified two major transcripts in the C13orf25 gene. The two transcripts A and 
      B predicted open reading frames of 32 and 70-amino acid polypeptides,
      respectively. The former has been reported as bA121J7.2, which is conserved among
      species. Transcript-B also contained seven mature microRNAs in its untranslated
      region. These results suggest that the C13orf25 gene is the most likely candidate
      gene for the 13q31-q32 amplicon found in hematopoietic malignancies.

TI  - Hepatitis C virus infection at Sharkia Governorate, Egypt: seroprevalence and
      associated risk factors.
PG  - 367-84
AB  - Because many persons with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are
      asymptomatic, population based serologic studies are needed to estimate the
      prevalence of infection and to develop and evaluate prevention efforts. A sample 
      of 1422 individuals was included in the study by using multistage sampling
      technique. Their age ranged from 4-78 years with a mean age (34.7 +/- 18.5), 782 
      were males (55%) and 640 were females (45%). Exposures and demographic
      characteristics were obtained through a predesigned questionnaire. Antibody to
      HCV was assessed using micro-particle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA) enzyme assay by
      IMX, and the HCV RNA was tested by Real-time PCR technique using ABI Prism 7700
      system. The seroprevalence of antibodies to HCV were 23.4% and 27.4% in urban and
      rural areas respectively, with an overall prevalence (25.8%). This reflects prior
      HCV infection but not necessarily a current liver disease. Prevalence was higher 
      among males than females and increased sharply with age, from 4.8% in those < 20 
      years old to (41.9%) in older ages (> or = 40 years). Those who were not educated
      and farmers had a significantly high prevalence. The significant predictors of
      HCV infection were previous parenteral therapy for schistosomiasis (OR = 4.3, 95%
      CI = 3.6-7.9), among those over 20 years of age (3.5, 2.18-5.8), blood
      transfusion (4.1, 2.4-6.9), invasive procedures (surgery and endoscopy), and use 
      of contaminated syringes and needles. Also, shaving at community barbers added
      significance to the model. Exposures not significantly related to HCV
      seropositivity were gender, active infection with Schistosoma mansoni, sutures or
      intravenous and urinary catheterization, water pipe "goza" smoking in group.

TI  - Opioidergic modulation of excitability of rat trigeminal root ganglion neuron
      projections to the superficial layer of cervical dorsal horn.
PG  - 995-1008
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a micro-opioid
      receptor agonist DAMGO (Tyr-d-Ala-Gly-NMe-Phe-Gly-ol) on the excitability of
      trigeminal root ganglion (TRG) neurons, projecting onto the superficial layer of 
      the cervical dorsal horn, by using the perforated-patch technique and to
      determine whether TRG neurons show the expression of mRNA or functional protein
      for micro-opioid receptors by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain
      reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. TRG neurons projecting onto the
      superficial layer of the cervical dorsal horn were retrogradely labeled with
      Fluorogold (FG). The cell diameter of FG-labeled TRG neurons was small (<30
      microm). Under voltage-clamp (V(h)=-60 mV), voltage-dependent K(+) currents were 
      recorded in the TRG neurons and isolated by blocking Na(+) and Ca(2+) currents
      with appropriate ion replacement. Separation of the K(+) current components was
      achieved by the response to variation in the conditioning voltage. Two distinct
      K(+) current components, a transient (I(A)) and sustained (I(K)), were
      identified. DAMGO significantly increased I(A) by 57% (20 microM) and in a
      dose-dependent manner (1-50 microM). Similarly, I(K) was also enhanced by DAMGO
      administration (42%, 20 microM). The augmentation of both I(A) and I(K) was
      antagonized by a micro-opioid receptor antagonist, CTOP
      (d-Phe-Cys-Thr-d-Trp-Orn-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH(2)). Hyperpolarization of the membrane
      potential was elicited by DAMGO (20 microM) and the response was associated with 
      a decrease in the input resistance. DAMGO induced hyperpolarization was blocked
      by CTOP. DAMGO-sensitive I(A) and I(K) currents were antagonized by K(+) channel 
      blockers, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and tetraethylammonium (TEA). In the presence of
      both 4-AP and TEA, no significant changes in membrane potential induced by DAMGO 
      application were observed. In the presence of BaCl(2), DAMGO evoked
      hyperpolarization with decreased resistance was observed. The firing rate of
      action potentials and the first spike duration induced by depolarizing step
      pulses were decreased in the presence of DAMGO. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated the 
      expression of mRNA for micro-opioid receptors in the trigeminal ganglia. The
      micro-opioid receptor immunoreactivity was expressed in the small diameter
      FG-labeled TRG neurons. These results suggest that the activation of micro-opioid
      receptors inhibits the excitability of rat small diameter TRG neurons projecting 
      on the superficial layer of the cervical dorsal horn and this inhibition is
      mediated by potentiation of voltage-dependent K(+) currents. We therefore
      concluded that modulation of nociceptive transmission in the trigeminal system,
      resulting in the functional activation of micro-opioid receptors, occurs at the
      level of small TRG cell bodies and/or their primary afferent terminals, which
      contribute to opioid analgesia in the trigeminal pain.

PG  - 734-6
AB  - RNA silencing processes are guided by small RNAs that are derived from
      double-stranded RNA. To probe for function of RNA silencing during infection of
      human cells by a DNA virus, we recorded the small RNA profile of cells infected
      by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). We show that EBV expresses several microRNA (miRNA) 
      genes. Given that miRNAs function in RNA silencing pathways either by targeting
      messenger RNAs for degradation or by repressing translation, we identified viral 
      regulators of host and/or viral gene expression.

TI  - Changes of atrial natriuretic peptide in rat supraoptic neurones during
      pregnancy.
PG  - 441-9
AB  - To better understand the role of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in the central 
      regulation of hydro-mineral homeostasis, we analysed its expression in rat
      hypothalamic neurones during gestation and postpartum. These physiological events
      are characterized by opposing body fluid regulations. Quantitative in situ
      hybridization analysis showed that starting from mid-pregnancy, ANP mRNA declined
      in neurones of the preoptic area, periventricular area, lateral hypothalamus and 
      endorhinal nucleus, and remained low at postpartum. By contrast, magnocellular
      cells in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) showed four- and 10-fold more ANP mRNA in
      sections from preterm and postpartum rats, respectively, compared to nonpregnant 
      controls (P < 0.001). Oxytocin mRNA paralleled ANP mRNA expression in the SON,
      whereas vasopressin mRNA rose in early pregnancy and declined thereafter. High
      hypothalamic ANP concentration at day 21 of gestation versus nonpregnant rats
      (3.1 +/- 0.5 versus 1.8 +/- 0.4 ng/mg protein, P < 0.05) suggested that ANP
      transcript accumulation in the SON is associated with increased utilization of
      the peptide. The elevation of hypothalamic ANP (two-fold) and ANP receptors by
      treatment of ovariectomized rats with 17beta-oestradiol (25 micro g/rat, 10 days)
      was abolished by coadministration of progesterone. Thus, we concluded that
      elevated oestradiol at term stimulates ANP synthesis and paracrine ANP activation
      in the hypothalamus. Overall, we provide experimental, anatomical and molecular
      evidence for ANP regulation in hypothalamic neurones at preterm and after
      17beta-oestradiol stimulation. Our study supports the concept that ANP expressed 
      in the SON acts as a peptidergic neurotransmitter involved in water and salt
      regulation during pregnancy and postpartum.

TI  - Lactobacillus casei alters hPEPT1-mediated glycylsarcosine uptake in Caco-2
      cells.
PG  - 1120-3
AB  - Augmentation of the normal flora of the gastrointestinal tract with probiotic
      bacteria is currently under investigation as a therapeutic tool for several
      diseases. However, it is unknown whether probiotic bacteria such as Lactobacillus
      casei alter the expression and function of intestinal transport proteins such as 
      hPEPT1. The effects of 24 and 48 h incubation of Caco-2 cells with 10(8)/L L.
      casei on the hPEPT1-mediated uptake rate of 20 micro mol/L [(3)H]glycylsarcosine 
      were examined. Dipeptide uptake did not differ from the control at 24 h (15.9 +/-
      2.4 vs. 11.5 +/- 1.4 cm.s(-1).mg protein(-1)); however, a significant increase in
      uptake occurred after 48 h of L. casei treatment (23.7 +/- 1.5 vs. 12.0 +/- 1.9
      cm.s(-1).mg protein(-1); P = 0.005). hPEPT1 involvement was confirmed in
      experiments using excess substrate. Increased uptake of [(3)H]glycylsarcosine
      appeared to be the result of the direct interaction of the bacteria with Caco-2
      cells because conditioned medium had no effect on dipeptide uptake. hPEPT1 mRNA
      levels did not differ at any time point. These results show that prolonged
      incubation of Caco-2 cells leads to increased hPEPT1 activity and that this
      occurs by a mechanism distinct from increased gene expression.

TI  - Wide variations in herpes simplex virus type 1 inoculum dose and
      latency-associated transcript expression phenotype do not alter the establishment
      of latency in the rabbit eye model.
PG  - 5038-44
AB  - The latency-associated transcript (LAT) is required for efficient reactivation of
      herpes simplex virus type 1 from latent infection in the rabbit eye model, but
      LAT's mechanism of action is unknown. In addition to reactivation, the LAT region
      seems to correspond to multiple functions, with some LAT deletion mutants
      exhibiting increased virulence, increased neuronal death, and restricted
      establishment of latency. While a LAT promoter deletion mutant (17DeltaPst) seems
      to be primarily restricted in reactivation in the rabbit, subtle effects on
      virulence or the establishment of latency cannot be precluded at the normal high 
      levels of virus inoculum used in the rabbit model. Since such additional LAT
      phenotypes may be more evident with lower doses of virus, we evaluated the
      influence of initial viral inoculum and LAT expression on the progression of
      acute infection and the establishment of latency. We have assayed both virus
      recovery rates and viral genome loads in rabbit corneas and trigeminal ganglia.
      Our results show that (i) in the corneas and trigeminal ganglia, the maximum
      amount of virus present during acute infection is independent of the LAT genotype
      and inoculum dose, although greater viral yields are obtained earlier with higher
      inoculum doses, and (ii) the range in numbers of latent genomes detected in the
      ganglia is independent of the inoculum dose and the LAT genotype and therefore no
      difference in establishment of latency is observed.

TI  - Amphivasal vascular bundle 1, a gain-of-function mutation of the IFL1/REV gene,
      is associated with alterations in the polarity of leaves, stems and carpels.
PG  - 369-85
AB  - In Arabidopsis stems, the vascular bundles in the stele are arranged in a
      ring-like pattern and the vascular tissues in each bundle are organized in a
      collateral pattern. We have shown previously that the semidominant amphivasal
      vascular bundle 1 (avb1) mutation transforms the collateral vascular bundles into
      amphivasal bundles and disrupts the ring-like arrangement of vascular bundles in 
      the stele. In this study, we show that the avb1 mutation occurred in the putative
      microRNA 165 target sequence in the IFL1/REV gene and caused an amino acid
      substitution in the putative sterol/lipid-binding START domain. We present direct
      evidence that the wild-type IFL1/REV mRNA was cleaved within the microRNA 165
      target sequence and the avb1 mutation resulted in an inhibition of cleavage and a
      higher level accumulation of full-length mRNA, suggesting a role of microRNA 165 
      in the regulation of IFL1/REV gene expression. In addition to an alteration in
      vascular patterning, the avb1 mutation also caused dramatic changes in fiber cell
      wall thickening and organ polarity, including aberrant formation and
      proliferation of cauline leaves and branches, production of trumpet-shaped leaves
      with reversed adaxial-abaxial identity, ectopic growth of carpel-like structures 
      on the outer surface of carpels, and fasciation of inflorescence. Ectopic
      overexpression of the avb1 mutant cDNA not only phenocopied most of the avb1
      mutant phenotypes but also led to additional novel phenotypes such as formation
      of leaves with extremely narrow blades and ectopic production of branches in the 
      axil of siliques. Taken together, these results suggest that the avb1
      gain-of-function mutation of the IFL1/REV gene alters the positional information 
      that determines vascular patterning and organ polarity.

TI  - Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 and human embryonic development
      during 6 - 10 gestational weeks.
PG  - 488-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), which is a
      carrier of Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) regulates the fetal development by 
      working as an active factor controlling the combination of IGFs with their
      receptors. This study was designed to investigate the relationship between
      IGFBP-1 and human embryonic development during weeks 6 - 10 of gestation.
      METHODS: A total of 44 pregnant women with singleton pregnancy were divided into 
      two groups: one with abnormal embryo development (n = 32) and the other with
      normal embryo development (n = 12). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was
      employed to detect IGFBP-1 levels in maternal serum and decidual tissue. The
      expression of IGFBP-1 mRNA in deciduas was examined by reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. RESULTS: The level of IGFBP-1
      protein in maternal serum was significantly higher in the abnormal group [(125.36
      +/- 47.93) micro g/ml] than in the normal group [(70.72 +/- 21.21) micro g/ml].
      Both of IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-1 mRNA in deciduas were higher in abnormal group [(1.60
      +/- 1.39) micro g/ml and 1.66 +/- 1.64, respectively] than in the normal group
      [(0.35 +/- 0.23) micro g/ml and 0.40 +/- 0.20, respectively]. The level of
      IGFBP-1 in maternal serum was positively correlated with IGFBP-1 mRNA (r = 0.90, 
      P < 0.05) and IGFBP-1 protein (r = 0.92, P < 0.05) in decidual tissue.
      CONCLUSIONS: During weeks 6 - 10 of gestation, abnormal embryonic development is 
      correlated with elevated IGFBP-1. The level of IGFBP-1 in maternal serum is
      related to the concentrations of IGFBP-1 mRNA and IGFBP-1 in decidual tissue. The
      IGFBP-1 level in maternal serum may be used as a predictive marker to evaluate
      embryonic development.

TI  - MicroRNA-directed cleavage of HOXB8 mRNA.
PG  - 594-6
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous approximately 22-nucleotide RNAs, some of which
      are known to play important regulatory roles in animals by targeting the messages
      of protein-coding genes for translational repression. We find that miR-196, a
      miRNA encoded at three paralogous locations in the A, B, and C mammalian HOX
      clusters, has extensive, evolutionarily conserved complementarity to messages of 
      HOXB8, HOXC8, and HOXD8. RNA fragments diagnostic of miR-196-directed cleavage of
      HOXB8 were detected in mouse embryos. Cell culture experiments demonstrated
      down-regulation of HOXB8, HOXC8, HOXD8, and HOXA7 and supported the cleavage
      mechanism for miR-196-directed repression of HOXB8. These results point to a
      miRNA-mediated mechanism for the posttranscriptional restriction of HOX gene
      expression during vertebrate development and demonstrate that metazoan miRNAs can
      repress expression of their natural targets through mRNA cleavage in addition to 
      inhibiting productive translation.

TI  - Reduction in PSA messenger-RNA expression and clinical recurrence in patients
      with prostatic cancer undergoing neoadjuvant therapy before radical
      prostatectomy.
PG  - 13
AB  - BACKGROUND: We assessed the incidence of micro-metastases at surgical margins
      (SM) and pelvic lymph nodes (LN) in patients submitted to radical retropubic
      prostatectomy (RP) after neoadjuvant therapy (NT) or to RP alone. We compared
      traditional staging to molecular detection of PSA using Taqman-based quantitative
      real-time PCR (qrt-PCR) never used before for this purpose. METHODS: 29 patients 
      were assigned to NT plus RP (arm A) or RP alone (arm B). Pelvic LN were dissected
      for qrt-PCR analysis, together with right and left lateral SM. RESULTS: 64,3%
      patients of arm B and 26.6% of arm A had evidence of PSA mRNA expression in LN
      and/or SM. 17,2% patients, all of arm B, had biochemical recurrence. CONCLUSIONS:
      Qrt-PCR may be more sensitive, compared to conventional histology, in identifying
      presence of viable prostate carcinoma cells in SM and LN. Gene expression of PSA 
      in surgical periprostatic samples might be considered as a novel and reliable
      indicator of minimal residual disease after NT.

      sequencing cDNAs prepared from the approximately 22-nt fraction of total RNA.
      Methods are described for the construction of cDNA libraries from small noncoding
      RNAs through the use of T4 RNA ligase, reverse transcriptase, and polymerase
      chain reaction. cDNAs are cloned in lambda or plasmid vectors, and the sequences 
      are compared to annotated genomic sequence databases, and analyzed by RNA folding
      programs to distinguish miRNA sequences from other small RNAs of similar size.
      Northern blot hybridization is used to confirm the expression of small RNAs in

TI  - Induction and biochemical purification of RNA-induced silencing complex from
      Drosophila S2 cells.
PG  - 59-72
AB  - The discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) has greatly simplified the process of
      suppressing genes in many experimental systems, including Caenorhabditis elegans,
      Drosophila, and mammalian cells. A sequence-specific nuclease complex, called the
      RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), can be purified from cells undergoing RNAi.
      RISC shows RNase activity when exposed to RNAs homologous to the input
      double-stranded RNA (dsRNAs) but lacks activity in the presence of nontargeted
      RNAs. We describe the induction of RNAi by dsRNA in cultured Drosophila
      Schneider-2 (S2) cells and detail procedures for RISC purification from these
      cells. This purification approach has allowed us to identify several RISC
      components, including siRNAs, Argo naute 2 (Ago-2), Drosophila Fragile X related 
      protein (dFXR), Vasa intronic gene (VIG), and the micrococcal nuclease family
      member Tudor-SN (Drosophila CG7008). RNAi is carried out by an endogenous pathway
      important for normal development in many organisms. In fact, organisms express
      hundreds of different microRNAs (miRNAs), small hairpin RNAs that function
      through the RNAi pathway to suppress expression of endogenous genes. The function
      of miRNAs is poorly understood, and most of their targets are unknown. Purified
      RISC complexes contain short interfering RNAs and endogenously expressed miRNAs
      and will be useful for studying many aspects of the RNAi machinery.

TI  - Viral virulence protein suppresses RNA silencing-mediated defense but upregulates
      the role of microrna in host gene expression.
PG  - 1302-13
AB  - Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are processed by the
      ribonuclease Dicer from distinct precursors, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and
      hairpin RNAs, respectively, although either may guide RNA silencing via a similar
      complex. The siRNA pathway is antiviral, whereas an emerging role for miRNAs is
      in the control of development. Here, we describe a virulence factor encoded by
      turnip yellow mosaic virus, p69, which suppresses the siRNA pathway but promotes 
      the miRNA pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana. p69 suppression of the siRNA pathway
      is upstream of dsRNA and is as effective as genetic mutations in A. thaliana
      genes involved in dsRNA production. Possibly as a consequence of p69 suppression,
      p69-expressing plants contained elevated levels of a Dicer mRNA and of miRNAs as 
      well as a correspondingly enhanced miRNA-guided cleavage of two host mRNAs.
      Because p69-expressing plants exhibited disease-like symptoms in the absence of
      viral infection, our findings suggest a novel mechanism for viral virulence by
      promoting the miRNA-guided inhibition of host gene expression.

TI  - Pegylated interferon alpha2b plus ribavirin for the treatment of chronic
      hepatitis C in HIV-infected patients.
PG  - 67-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV coinfection constitutes an important 
      epidemiological and clinical problem. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of
      Pegylated interferon alpha2b (Peg-IFN) and a fixed dose of ribavirin in the
      treatment of chronic hepatitis C in HIV coinfection. METHODS: Open, prospective
      study in HCV-HIV coinfected patients with persistently elevated alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT) levels and a liver biopsy showing either portal or
      bridging fibrosis. Therapy included Peg-IFN (50 micro g weekly) with ribavirin
      800 mg for 48 weeks. The primary end point was sustained virological response
      (SVR). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine factors
      associated with response. RESULTS: By intent-to-treat analysis, 11 of 35 patients
      (31%) reached SVR. SVR was significantly better for genotypes 2/3 than for
      genotype 1 (54% versus 21%; P < 0.05). By multivariate logistic regression
      analysis, only a non-1 genotype was an independent factor for SVR [odds ratio
      (OR), 6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-31.7; P < 0.005]. A decrease of at
      least 1.5 log10 HCV RNA at week 12 of therapy was highly predictive of SVR (OR,
      49.9; 95% CI, 4.9-508.2; P < 0.001). Most patients developed adverse events,
      although only six patients (17%) discontinued treatment due to toxicity.
      CONCLUSIONS: The combination of low doses of Peg-IFN plus a fixed dose of
      ribavirin resulted in a rate of SVR similar to that obtained with higher doses of
      the drugs in HIV-infected patients and lower than those obtained in non-HIV
      patients. Response at week 12 may be useful to help guide therapy in HCV-HIV
      co-infected patients.

TI  - Real-time RT-PCR for gene expression profiling in blood of heart failure
      patients-a pilot study: gene expression in blood of heart failure patients.
PG  - 230-8
AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are associated with multiple changes in gene expression. 
      In general, cardiac tissue is not accessible to expression analysis. This study
      was designed to investigate expression of cardiac significant genes in white
      blood cells of heart failure patients and to identify differentially expressed
      genes. The quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
      (RT-PCR) method was used for quantification of messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts
      in blood samples of 20 patients (NYHA III-IV) with severe heart failure and of 20
      healthy controls (NYHA I). Total RNA was extracted from leukocytes, reverse
      transcribed into cDNA, amplified and quantitated by SYBR Green detection.
      Relative mRNA expression was calculated using phosphoglycerate kinase-1 ( PGK-1) 
      gene expression as an endogenous reference. Identified were 14 genes relevant to 
      cardiomyocyte excitability or contractility. Most of them had not been previously
      reported to be expressed in blood cells. Data was based on 0.5 micro g total RNA 
      applied to RT-PCR and on leukocyte number. In both, an increased transcription
      level of the Na/Ca exchanger ( NCX) was found in blood of heart failure patients 
      as compared to controls (p < 0.02), in line with an upregulated NCX expression
      known from myocardial tissue of heart failure patients. This pilot study
      demonstrates that NCX transcription increased in potential relation to heart
      failure disease.

TI  - Mechanisms by which SGN-40, a humanized anti-CD40 antibody, induces cytotoxicity 
      in human multiple myeloma cells: clinical implications.
PG  - 2846-52
AB  - CD40 is expressed on B-cell malignancies, including human multiple myeloma (MM)
      and a variety of carcinomas. We examined the potential therapeutic utility of
      SGN-40, the humanized anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody, for treating human MM using 
      MM cell lines and patient MM cells (CD138(++), CD40(+)). SGN-40 (0.01-100 micro
      g/ml) induces modest cytotoxicity in MM cell lines and patient MM cells. In the
      presence of de novo protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, SGN-40
      significantly induced apoptosis in Dexamethasone (Dex)-sensitive MM.1S and
      Dex-resistant MM.1R cells and in patient MM cells. SGN-40-mediated cytotoxicity
      is associated with up-regulation of cytotoxic ligands of the tumor necrosis
      factor family (Fas/FasL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand,
      and tumor necrosis factor alpha). SGN-40 treatment also induces a down-regulation
      of CD40 dependent on an endocytic pathway. Consequently, pretreatment of MM cells
      with SGN-40 blocked sCD40L-mediated phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/AKT and
      nuclear factor kappaB activation. Importantly, pretreatment of MM.1S and MM.1R
      cells with SGN-40 inhibited proliferation triggered by interleukin 6 (IL-6) but
      not by insulin-like growth factor-I. In addition, SGN-40 pretreatment of MM.1S
      cells blocked the ability of IL-6 to protect against Dex-induced inhibition of
      DNA synthesis. This was associated with a 2-4-fold reduction of IL-6 receptor at 
      protein and mRNA levels in SGN-40-treated MM.1S cells and patient MM cells. Taken
      together, these results provide the preclinical rationale for the evaluation of
      SGN-40 as a potential new therapy to improve patient outcome in MM.

TI  - The cloning and characterization of a second brain enzyme with NAAG peptidase
      activity.
PG  - 627-35
AB  - The peptide neurotransmitter N-acetylaspartylglutamate is inactivated by
      extracellular peptidase activity following synaptic release. It is speculated
      that the enzyme, glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII, EC 3.14.17.21),
      participates in this inactivation. However, CGCPII knockout mice appear normal in
      standard neurological tests. We report here the cloning and characterization of a
      mouse enzyme (tentatively identified as glutamate carboxypeptidase III or GCPIII)
      that is homologous to an enzyme identified in a human lung carcinoma. The mouse
      peptidase was cloned from two non-overlapping EST clones and mouse brain cDNA
      using PCR. The sequence (GenBank, AY243507) is 85% identical to the human
      carcinoma enzyme and 70% homologous to mouse GCPII. GCPIII sequence analysis
      suggests that it too is a zinc metallopeptidase. Northern blots revealed message 
      in mouse ovary, testes and lung, but not brain. Mouse cortical and cerebellar
      neurons in culture expressed GCPIII message in contrast to the glial specific
      expression of GCPII. Message levels of GCPIII were similar in brains obtained
      from wild-type mice and mice that are null mutants for GCPII. Chinese hamster
      ovary (CHO) cells transfected with rat GCPII or mouse GCPIII expressed membrane
      bound peptidase activity with similar V(max) and K(m) values (1.4 micro m and 54 
      pmol/min/mg; 3.5 micro m and 71 pmol/min/mg, respectively). Both enzymes are
      activated by a similar profile of metal ions and their activities are blocked by 
      EDTA. GCPIII message was detected in brain and spinal cord by RT-PCR with highest
      levels in the cerebellum and hippocampus. These data are consistent with the
      hypothesis that nervous system cells express at least two differentially
      distributed homologous enzymes with similar pharmacological properties and
      affinity for NAAG.

TI  - Structural aspects of microRNA biogenesis.
PG  - 95-100
AB  - One of the biggest surprises at the beginning of the 'post-genome era' was the
      discovery of numerous genes encoding microRNAs. They were found in genomes of
      such diverse organisms as Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster,
      Arabidopsis thaliana, and Homo sapiens which implies their important role in
      multicellular life evolution. The number of microRNA genes is estimated to be
      nearly 1% of that of protein-coding genes. Their products, tiny RNAs, are thought
      to regulate gene expression during development, organogenesis, and very likely
      during many other processes, by hybridizing to their target mRNAs. The cellular
      functions of mRNAs that are regulated by microRNAs are only beginning to be
      revealed, and details of this regulation mechanism are still poorly understood.
      In this article we discuss the possible mechanisms of microRNA biogenesis with
      special emphasis on their structural aspects. We have focused on the factors and 
      effects that may be responsible for the existing length differences between
      different microRNAs, and for the observed length heterogeneity within some
      individual microRNA species.

TI  - Probing the microRNA and small interfering RNA pathways with virus-encoded
      suppressors of RNA silencing.
PG  - 1235-50
AB  - In plants, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are effectors
      of RNA silencing, a process involved in defense through RNA interference (RNAi)
      and in development. Plant viruses are natural targets of RNA silencing, and as a 
      counterdefensive strategy, they have evolved highly diverse silencing suppressor 
      proteins. Although viral suppressors are usually thought to act at distinct steps
      of the silencing machinery, there had been no consensus system so far that
      allowed a strict side-by-side analysis of those factors. We have set up such a
      system in Arabidopsis thaliana and used it to compare the effects of five
      unrelated viral silencing suppressors on the siRNA and miRNA pathways. Although
      all the suppressors inhibited RNAi, only three of them induced developmental
      defects, indicating that the two pathways are only partially overlapping. These
      developmental defects were remarkably similar, and their penetrance correlated
      with inhibition of miRNA-guided cleavage of endogenous transcripts and not with
      altered miRNA accumulation per se. Among the suppressors investigated, the
      tombusviral P19 protein coimmunoprecipitated with siRNA duplexes and miRNA
      duplexes corresponding to the primary cleavage products of miRNA precursors.
      Thus, it is likely that P19 prevents RNA silencing by sequestering both classes
      of small RNAs. Moreover, the finding here that P19 binds siRNAs and suppresses
      RNAi in Hela cells also suggests that this factor may be useful to dissect the
      RNA silencing pathways in animals. Finally, the differential effects of the
      silencing suppressors tested here upon other types of Arabidopsis
      silencing-related small RNAs revealed a surprising variety of biosynthetic and,
      presumably, functional pathways for those molecules. Therefore, silencing
      suppressors are valuable probes of the complexity of RNA silencing.

TI  - Detection of metastases in sentinel lymph nodes of breast cancer patients by
      multiple mRNA markers.
PG  - 1531-7
AB  - Disseminated breast tumour cells in sentinel lymph nodes (SNs) were evaluated by 
      quantitative real-time PCR and the sensitivity of this assay was compared to the 
      routine histological analysis. First, several candidate marker genes were tested 
      for their specificity in axillary lymph nodes (ALN) of 50 breast cancer patients 
      and 43 women without breast cancer. The marker gene panel selected, designed to
      detect the mRNA of CK19, p1B, EGP2 and SBEM, was subsequently applied to detect
      metastases in 70 SNs that were free of metastases as determined by standard
      histological evaluation. Remarkably, seven negative SNs showed increased marker
      gene expression, suggesting the presence of (micro) metastases. Four of these
      seven SNs positive by real-time PCR proved to contain tumour deposits after
      careful review of the slides or further sectioning of the paraffin-embedded
      material. In three PCR positive SNs, however, no tumour cells were found by
      haematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E) and immunohistologically analysis. The
      quantitative real-time PCR assay with multiple mRNA markers for the detection of 
      disseminated breast cancer cells in SNs thus resulted in an upstaging of SNs
      containing metastastic disease of 10% compared to the routine histological
      analysis. The application of this technique may be of clinical relevance, as it
      is suggested that micrometastatic disease in SNs are associated with further
      nodal non-SN metastases in breast cancer.

TI  - [Advances in the molecular mechanism of RNA interference].
PG  - 161-5
AB  - This paper reviews the latest development of RNA interference(RNAi). RNA
      interference is the process of sequence-specific degradation of homologous mRNA
      triggered by double-stranded RNA. As a technically simple and an effective
      genetic tool which can exert effect on the expression of gene and substitute for 
      gene knock-out technique in some degree, RNAi phenomena have been broadly
      validated in diverse model organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila
      melanogaster, Arabidopsis thaliana and Neurospora crassa. Simultaneously, study
      on molecular mechanism of RNAi, which might be involved in the level of
      post-transcription, translation, genome methylation or conduction of silencing
      signals, is now making unceasing progress. Clear elucidation of the molecular
      mechanism could provide important theoretical references and powerful tools for
      the practical application in this field where RNAi may be put into the use of
      systematic gene screening, the discovery of new genes and the gene therapy for
      human tumor or other refractory human diseases.

TI  - Identification of chimpanzee Fab fragments by repertoire cloning and production
      of a full-length humanized immunoglobulin G1 antibody that is highly efficient
      for neutralization of dengue type 4 virus.
PG  - 4665-74
AB  - A safe and effective dengue vaccine is still not available. Passive immunization 
      with monoclonal antibodies from humans or nonhuman primates represents an
      attractive alternative for the prevention of dengue virus infection. Fab
      monoclonal antibodies to dengue type 4 virus (DENV-4) were recovered by
      repertoire cloning of bone marrow mRNAs from an immune chimpanzee and analyzed
      for antigen binding specificity, V(H) and V(L) sequences, and neutralizing
      activity against DENV-4 in vitro. Fabs 5A7, 3C1, 3E4, and 7G4 were isolated from 
      a library constructed from a chimpanzee following intrahepatic transfection with 
      infectious DENV-4 RNA. Fabs 5H2 and 5D9, which had nearly identical V(H)
      sequences but varied in their V(L) sequences, were recovered from a library
      constructed from the same chimpanzee after superinfection with a mixture of
      DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3. In radioimmunoprecipitation, Fab 5A7 precipitated
      only DENV-4 prM, and Fabs 3E4, 7G4, 5D9, and 5H2 precipitated DENV-4 E but little
      or no prM. Fab 3E4 and Fab 7G4 competed with each other for binding to DENV-4 in 
      an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as did Fab 3C1 and Fab 5A7. Fab 5H2
      recognized an epitope on DENV-4 that was separate from the epitope(s) recognized 
      by other Fabs. Both Fab 5H2 and Fab 5D9 neutralized DENV-4 efficiently with a
      titer of 0.24 to 0.58 micro g/ml by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), 
      whereas DENV-4-neutralizing activity of other Fabs was low or not detected. Fab
      5H2 was converted to full-length immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) by combining it with
      human sequences. The humanized chimpanzee antibody IgG1 5H2 produced in CHO cells
      neutralized DENV-4 strains from different geographical origins at a similar 50%
      plaque reduction (PRNT(50)) titer of 0.03 to 0.05 micro g/ml. The DENV-4 binding 
      affinities were 0.42 nM for Fab 5H2 and 0.24 nM for full-length IgG1 5H2.
      Monoclonal antibody IgG1 5H2 may prove valuable for passive immunoprophylaxis
      against dengue virus in humans.

TI  - Administration of oral probiotic bacteria to pregnant women causes temporary
      infantile colonization.
PG  - 293-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is difficult to permanently change the composition of the complex 
      intestinal microflora of the adult. Orally administered probiotic bacteria
      produce only temporary colonization of the intestine in patients with a fully
      developed gut microflora. The gastrointestinal tract of a healthy fetus is
      sterile. During the birth process and rapidly thereafter, microbes from the
      mother and the surrounding environment colonize the gastrointestinal tract until 
      a dense, complex microflora develops. Probiotic bacteria have been shown to
      beneficially influence the intestinal and systemic immune system and mediate
      protection against nosocomial infections affecting the neonate. OBJECTIVES: The
      purpose of this study was to determine whether oral administration of the
      probiotic micro-organism Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG (L. GG) to the
      pregnant woman leads to colonization of the newborn infant. METHODS: The authors 
      identified six women who were taking L. GG during late pregnancy. None of the
      children received L. GG after birth, and their mothers discontinued its
      consumption at the time of delivery. L. GG concentration in fecal samples was
      determined by colony morphology and molecular analysis. RESULTS: In all four
      children delivered vaginally and in one of two children delivered by cesarean
      section, L. GG was present in fecal samples at 1 and 6 months of age. Three
      children remained colonized for at least 12 months, and in two children L. GG was
      detected in fecal samples at 24 months of age. Three mothers were tested 1 month 
      post partum and no L. GG was present in fecal samples. No L. GG was found in one 
      of these women 24 months post partum. There was no L. GG detectable in stools of 
      the siblings of two children at the 2-year and 3-years after birth of the index
      child. L. GG was not isolated from the stools of children whose mothers were not 
      taking L. GG. CONCLUSIONS: Temporary colonization of an infant with L. GG may be 
      possible by colonizing the pregnant mother before delivery. Colonization is
      stable for as long as 6 months, and in unexplained circumstances may persist for 
      as long as 24 months.

TI  - Expression of apoptosis-related factors in muscles infected with Trichinella
      spiralis.
PG  - 323-32
AB  - We found that the expression of mitochondrial apoptosis related genes (Bcl-2
      associated protein X, BAX; apoptotic protease activating factor 1, Apaf-1;
      Caspase 9 and serine/threonine protein kinase, PKB) is elevated in Trichinella
      spiralis-infected muscles during encapsulation. Micro-dissection of the capsule
      and subsequent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed
      that the expressions of these genes are restricted to the nurse cell.
      Immunocytochemistry revealed that pro-apoptosis factor (BAX, Apaf-1 and Caspase
      9) are predominantly expressed in the basophilic cytoplasm (infected muscle cell 
      origin) and anti-apoptosis factor (PKB) in the eosinophilic cytoplasm (satellite 
      cell origin) of the nurse cell. Electron microscopy revealed that the
      pre-existing mitochondria in the muscle cells became swollen and disappeared
      immediately after newborn larva invasion, but new mitochondria of smaller size
      appeared in the cytoplasm. Nuclear fragmentation and condensation were observed
      in basophilic cytoplasm which is known to die. Together, the results suggest that
      the infected muscle cells transform but die through the process of apoptosis
      which is triggered by factors from the newly formed mitochondria. The
      anti-apoptosis factor may help the eosinophilic cytoplasm with its survival to
      ensure nurse cell function.

TI  - RNA interference as a new biotechnological tool for the control of virus diseases
      in plants.
PG  - 85-96
AB  - RNA silencing occurs in a wide variety of organisms, including protozoa, fungi,
      plants and animals and involves recognition of a target RNA and initiation of a
      sequence-specific RNA degradation pathway in the cytoplasm. In the last few
      years, there have been considerable advances in our understanding of
      post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). This mechanism is conceived as a
      natural antiviral defense system in plants that is activated as a response to
      double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) formed during virus replication. To develop new
      approaches for plant protection against virus diseases based on PTGS we have
      expanded previous findings on RNA interference (RNAi) in animals by using dsRNA
      to specifically interfere with virus infection in plants. This approach differs
      from strategies based on transgenic expression of RNAs but still relies on PTGS
      as a means to achieve pathogen-derived resistance (PDR). Our findings suggest
      that exogenously supplied dsRNA could form the basis for the development of an
      environmentally safe, new biotechnological tool aimed at protecting crops against
      virus diseases, provided that some limitations of the current status of the
      approach could be overcome.

TI  - Derivation and function of small interfering RNAs and microRNAs.
PG  - 3-9
AB  - Small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes are generally produced by Dicer cleavage
      of double-stranded RNAs of frequently exogenous origin and can induce the
      cleavage and degradation of mRNAs bearing an identical sequence. In contrast,
      microRNAs (miRNAs) are encoded within the eukaryotic genome as short RNA hairpin 
      structures. While these pre-miRNAs are also processed by Dicer, mature miRNAs
      appear to function primarily by inhibiting the translation of mRNAs bearing
      multiple, partially mismatched target sites. Nevertheless, recent data argue that
      the posttranscriptional regulatory machinery utilized by siRNAs and miRNAs is
      largely or entirely identical. In this review, I will discuss recent progress in 
      unraveling the RNA processing pathway utilized for the biosynthesis of mature
      miRNAs and argue that this pathway offers at least three distinct entry points
      for the functional expression of artificial siRNAs in vertebrate cells. While
      each of these entry points offers distinct advantages and disadvantages, they all
      have the potential to induce the effective knock-down of specific genes either in
      cell culture or in experimental animals.

TI  - Mechanism of action of low recurrence of gastritis caused by Helicobacter pylori 
      with the type II urease B gene.
PG  - 173-80
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low recurrence of gastritis is seen in patients infected with
      Helicobacter pylori carrying the type II urease B gene, compared with H. pylori
      carrying types I and III. The underlying mechanism has been studied in terms of
      the urease activity and interleukin (IL)-8 production capacity of different
      strains of H. pylori. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-five patients infected with
      different strains of H. pylori (type I; 15, type II; 15 and type III; 15) were
      enrolled in the study. H. pylori was isolated from gastric mucosa and cultured in
      the presence of urea at pH 5.5 to evaluate urease activity. The capacity of
      different strains of H. pylori to induce IL-8 mRNA and IL-8 from a human gastric 
      cancer cell line and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells was evaluated.
      RESULTS: The urease activity of type II H. pylori[523 +/- 228 micro g of
      ammonia/dl/10(8) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml] was significantly lower than that
      of type I (1355 +/- 1369 micro g of ammonia/dl/10(8) CFU/ml) and type III (1442
      +/- 2229 micro g of ammonia/dl/10(8) CFU/ml) (p <.05). Gastric cancer cells
      cocultured with type II H. pylori produced lower levels of IL-8 mRNA compared
      with type I and type III H. pylori. The levels of IL-8 were also significantly
      lower in cultures induced by type II H. pylori compared with those induced by
      type I and type III H. pylori. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells also produced
      lower levels of IL-8 when cocultured with type II compared with type I H. pylori.
      CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that both the lower level of urease activity 
      and the low IL-8-inducing capacity of type II H. pylori might underlie the lower 
      recurrence rate of gastritis caused by type II H. pylori.

TI  - Relationship of species-specific filament levels to filamentous bulking in
      activated sludge.
PG  - 2420-8
AB  - To examine the relationship between activated-sludge bulking and levels of
      specific filamentous bacteria, we developed a statistics-based quantification
      method for estimating the biomass levels of specific filaments using 16S
      rRNA-targeted fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) probes. The results of
      quantitative FISH for the filament Sphaerotilus natans were similar to the
      results of quantitative membrane hybridization in a sample from a full-scale
      wastewater treatment plant. Laboratory-scale reactors were operated under
      different flow conditions to develop bulking and nonbulking sludge and were
      bioaugmented with S. natans cells to stimulate bulking. Instead of S. natans, the
      filament Eikelboom type 1851 became dominant in the reactors. Levels of type 1851
      filaments extending out of the flocs correlated strongly with the sludge volume
      index, and extended filament lengths of approximately 6 x 10(8) micro m ml(-1)
      resulted in bulking in laboratory-scale and full-scale activated-sludge samples. 
      Quantitative FISH showed that high levels of filaments occurred inside the flocs 
      in nonbulking sludge, supporting the "substrate diffusion limitation" hypothesis 
      for bulking. The approach will allow the monitoring of incremental improvements
      in bulking control methods and the delineation of the operational conditions that
      lead to bulking due to specific filaments.

TI  - Detection of noroviruses in tap water in Japan by means of a new method for
      concentrating enteric viruses in large volumes of freshwater.
PG  - 2154-60
AB  - A virus concentration method using a cation-coated filter was developed for
      large-volume freshwater applications. Poliovirus type 1 (LSc 2ab Sabin strain)
      inoculated into 40 ml of MilliQ (ultrapure) water was adsorbed effectively to a
      negatively charged filter (Millipore HA, 0.45- micro m pore size) coated with
      aluminum ions, 99% (range, 81 to 114%) of which were recovered by elution with
      1.0 mM NaOH (pH 10.8) following an acid rinse with 0.5 mM H(2)SO(4) (pH 3.0).
      More than 80% poliovirus recovery yields were obtained from 500-ml, 1,000-ml, and
      10-liter MilliQ water samples and from tap water samples. This method, followed
      by TaqMan PCR detection, was applied to determine the presence of noroviruses in 
      tap water in Tokyo, Japan. In a 14-month survey, 4 (4.1%) and 7 (7.1%) of 98 tap 
      water samples (100 to 532 liters) contained a detectable amount of noroviruses of
      genotype 1 and genotype 2, respectively. This method was proved to be useful for 
      surveying the occurrence of enteric viruses, including noroviruses, in large
      volumes of freshwater.

TI  - Distinct roles for Drosophila Dicer-1 and Dicer-2 in the siRNA/miRNA silencing
      pathways.
PG  - 69-81
AB  - The RNase III enzyme Dicer processes RNA into siRNAs and miRNAs, which direct a
      RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to cleave mRNA or block its translation
      (RNAi). We have characterized mutations in the Drosophila dicer-1 and dicer-2
      genes. Mutation in dicer-1 blocks processing of miRNA precursors, whereas dicer-2
      mutants are defective for processing siRNA precursors. It has been recently found
      that Drosophila Dicer-1 and Dicer-2 are also components of siRNA-dependent RISC
      (siRISC). We find that Dicer-1 and Dicer-2 are required for siRNA-directed mRNA
      cleavage, though the RNase III activity of Dicer-2 is not required. Dicer-1 and
      Dicer-2 facilitate distinct steps in the assembly of siRISC. However, Dicer-1 but
      not Dicer-2 is essential for miRISC-directed translation repression. Thus,
      siRISCs and miRISCs are different with respect to Dicers in Drosophila.

TI  - Dicers at RISC; the mechanism of RNAi.
PG  - 1-3
AB  - The pathway of RNA interference starts when Dicer cuts dsRNA into small
      interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that subsequently target homologous mRNAs for
      destruction. microRNA processing from stem loop precursors similarly requires
      Dicer activity. Two papers in this issue of Cell now demonstrate that Dicer is
      also essential for the execution phase of RNAi and explore the distinct
      requirements for Dicers in the siRNA and miRNA pathways.

TI  - Managing the genome: microRNAs in Drosophila.
PG  - 74-80
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a growing class of short non-coding RNAs that
      regulate gene expression by post-transcriptional mechanisms. By binding to target
      mRNAs via stretches of sequence complementarity, microRNAs inhibit the production
      of target proteins or induce degradation of mRNAs. Several hundred miRNAs have
      recently been predicted and cloned from eukaryotic organisms as diverse as
      plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates. Some miRNAs were shown to be widely
      conserved across phyla. However, except in a few described cases, rather little
      is known about their endogenous target genes and the physiological pathways they 
      impinge on. Invertebrate model organisms such as C. elegans and Drosophila have
      been instrumental to develop methods and to dissect biological roles of miRNAs.
      In this review, we will focus on recent progress in characterizing miRNAs and
      steps toward identification of target genes in Drosophila. Many of these recent
      experiments provide evidence that a systematic target discovery is feasible and
      that the biology of miRNAs can be functionally explored using forward and reverse
      genetic tools.

TI  - RNA silencing in plants: a shortcut to functional analysis.
PG  - 65-73
AB  - RNA silencing is a rapidly expanding research field, not only because it is a
      fundamental biological issue but also because its application in the control of
      gene expression is highly promising. Post-transcriptional gene silencing in
      plants is a form of RNA silencing by which target RNA is degraded in a
      sequence-specific manner. Findings regarding the central role that
      double-stranded RNA plays in triggering RNA silencing have prompted the
      development of many modified methods for RNA silencing. These methods, in
      combination with the development of genomic resources, have provided rapid and
      efficient means by which to investigate gene function in a wide range of plant
      species. This review addresses the technical aspects of RNA silencing in plants
      by introducing the principles of several methods of RNA silencing, as well as the
      advantages and disadvantages of each method.

TI  - World of small RNAs: from ribozymes to siRNA and miRNA.
PG  - 58-64
AB  - RNAs, besides bridging genetic information to proteins, the major determinants of
      bio-structures and functions, serve as active regulators of gene expression.
      Initiated nearly 20 years ago with ribozymes (the small RNAs with catalytic
      activity providing fine tuning of gene expression and function, used as molecular
      scissors and tools for gene discovery), an era of more complex and coordinated
      gene regulation by small RNAs, siRNA, and miRNA has recently started. Simple
      nucleotide complementarity results in highly ordered and regulated events, such
      as assembly of RNA and proteins, resulting in gene silencing either by mRNA
      degradation or suppression of translation. This article reviews our contributions
      to the understanding of structure, the function of small RNAs, their use in
      biotechnology, and the understanding of phenotypes such as apoptosis, metastasis,
      and differentiation.

TI  - Functional importance of Ca2+-activated K+ channels for lysophosphatidic
      acid-induced microglial migration.
PG  - 1469-74
AB  - Abstract Migration of microglial cells towards damaged tissue plays a key role in
      central nervous system regeneration under pathological conditions. Using time
      lapse video microscopy we show that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) enhances
      chemokinetic migration of murine microglial cells. In the presence of 1 micro m
      LPA, the mean migration rate of microglial cells was increased 3.8-fold. In
      patch-clamp studies we demonstrate that LPA induces activation of a
      Ca(2+)-activated K(+) current. Microglial Ca(2+)-activated K(+) currents were
      abolished by either 50 nm charybdotoxin or 10 micro m clotrimazole. In contrast, 
      5 micro m paxilline did not have any significant effects on Ca(2+)-activated K(+)
      currents. The LPA-stimulated migration of microglial cells was inhibited by
      blockers of IKCa1 Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels. The mean migration rate of
      LPA-stimulated cells was decreased by 61% in the presence of 50 nm charybdotoxin 
      or by 51% during exposure to 10 micro m clotrimazole. Microglial migration was
      not inhibited by 5 micro m paxilline. It is concluded that IKCa1 Ca(2+)-activated
      K(+) channels are required for LPA-stimulated migration of microglial cells.

TI  - 2'-O-methyl-modified phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides have reduced
      non-specific effects in vitro.
PG  - 2008-16
AB  - Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) have biological activity in treating
      various forms of cancer. The antisense effects of two types of 20mer ODNs,
      phosphorothioate-modified ODNs (S-ODNs) and S-ODNs with 12 2'-O-methyl groups
      (Me-S-ODNs), targeted to sites 109 and 277 of bcl-2 mRNA, were compared. Both
      types were at least as effective as G3139 (Genta, Inc.) in reducing the level of 
      Bcl-2 protein in T24 cells following a 4 h transfection at a dose of 0.1 micro M.
      Circular dichroism spectra showed that both types formed A-form duplexes with the
      complementary RNA, and the melting temperatures were in the order of Me-S-ODN.RNA
      > normal DNA.RNA > S-ODN.RNA. In comparison with the S-ODN, the Me-S-ODN had
      reduced toxic growth inhibitory effects, was less prone to bind the DNA-binding
      domain A of human replication protein A, and was as resistant to serum nucleases.
      Neither type of oligomer induced apoptosis, according to a PARP-cleavage assay.
      Hybrids formed with Me-S-ODN sequences were less sensitive to RNase H degradation
      than those formed with S-ODN sequences. Despite this latter disadvantage, the
      addition of 2'-O-methyl groups to a phosphorothioate-modified ODN is advantageous
      because of increased stability of binding and reduced non-specific effects.

PG  - 107-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of c9,t11-conjugated linoleic acid on the killing
      ability of macrophage to B16-MB cells in C57 mice and explore its possible
      mechanism. METHODS: The five levels of CLA was designed as 0, 25, 50, 75, 100
      micro mol/L. After macrophage was treated with CLA for 24 h, the killing ability 
      of macrophage on B16-MB cells was evaluated by MTT, The expression of C57 mice
      macrophage cytokine IL-6, TNF-alpha and iNOS mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. The
      expression of Erk protein was examined by Western Blot assay. RESULTS: The
      inhibitory effect of macrophage on tumor cell depend on the treatment of the
      increased c9,t11-CLA level, at the same time, the expression of IL-6, TNF-alpha
      and iNOS mRNA increased, the expression of Erk decreased with the elevating dose 
      of CLA. CONCLUSIONS: c9,t11-CLA could increase the killing ability of macrophage 
      in mice to B16-MB cells, and it was associated with induction of IL-6, TNF-alpha 
      and iNOS mRNA expression. We speculate that antitumor ability of CLA may be
      associated with taking part in body immune regulation action, and the effects of 
      CLA on the killing ability of murine macrophage to B16-MB cells was not
      associated with the MAPKErk pathway.

TI  - [Anti-endotoxin effect of lanthanum chloride in vivo: an experimental study of
      mice].
PG  - 242-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lanthanum is one of rare earth with extremely active chemical property
      and has been evidenced to possess antibacterial effect as well as the function of
      blocking calcium flux and regulating cellular immunity. Our previous studies
      showed that lanthanum could affect the biological activity of LPS and inhibit the
      activity in vitro. In this study, we explored the anti-LPS effects of lanthanum
      chloride in vivo so as to provide evidence in searching for new anti-endotoxic
      agents for the prevention and treatment of endotoxemia. METHODS: (1) 96 BALB/c
      mice were divided into 2 groups: experimental group including 84 mice injected
      intraperitoneally with 17.5 mg/kg, LD(50) dose, of LPS mixed with lanthanum
      chloride of the dosages of 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 40
      mg/kg, and 80 mg/kg respectively; and control group including 12 mice injected
      intraperitoneally with 17.5 mg/kg of LPS. The mortality rates of different mice
      within 7 days were observed so as to observe the protective effect of lanthanum
      chloride. (2) 40 BALB/c mice were randomly divided into 2 group 2: experimental
      group injected intraperitoneally with lanthanum chloride of the dosages 10 mg/kg 
      for 3 days and then injected with 1 LD(50) dosage of LPS 30 minutes after the
      last injection of lanthanum chloride of the dosages 10 mg/kg; and control group
      injected intraperitoneally with normal saline for 3 days and then with 1 LD(50)
      dosage of LPS 30 minutes after the last injection of normal saline. The mortality
      rates of different mice within 7 days were observed. (3) 40 BALB/c mice were
      randomly divided into 4 groups: LPS group, injected intraperitoneally with LPS of
      sublethal dosage (12.5 mg/kg), lanthanum chloride treatment group, injected
      intraperitoneally with LPS of sublethal dosage 1 hour after the venous injection 
      of 10 mg/kg lanthanum chloride, lanthanum chloride control group, injected
      intravenously with 10 mg/kg lanthanum chloride, and NS control group, injected
      intraperitoneally with NS. Four hours after the intraperitoneal injection blood
      sample were collected to detect the plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha)
      and liver and thymus tissues were collected to examine the expression of TNFalpha
      mRNA and apoptosis of thymocytes by Rt-PCR and flow cytometry so as to observe
      the effects of lanthanum chloride on LPS-induced reaction in vivo. RESULTS: The
      mortality rates of the mice administrated with LD(50) dosage of LPS combined with
      5, 10, and 20 mg/kg lanthanum chloride were 0, 0, and 8% respectively, all
      significantly lower than that of the control group (67%, all P < 0.01). The
      mortality rate of the LPS-challenged mice that were pretreated with 10 mg/kg of
      lanthanum chloride was 20%, significantly lower than that of the control group
      (55%, P < 0.05). (2) In the mice with endotoxemia that were pretreated with
      lanthanum chloride the plasma TNFalpha level was 0.44 +/- 0.22 ng/ml and the
      TNFalpha mRNA expression in liver was (3.93 +/- 0.62) x 10(5) copies/ micro g
      RNA, both significantly lower than those of the mice with endotoxemia without
      pretreatment of lanthanum chloride, 0.99 +/- 0.24 ng/ml and (1.9 +/- 0.33) x
      10(7) copies/ micro g RNA (both P < 0.001). The percentage of DNA fragmentation
      of thymocytes in the mice challenged with LPS and pretreated with lanthanum
      chloride was 14.77% +/- 1.0%, significantly lower than that of the untreated mice
      (55.38% +/- 3.88%, P < 0.001), the percentage of hypodiploidy in thymocytes of
      the mice challenged with LPS was 15.56% +/- 0.59%, significantly higher than that
      of the lanthanum chloride treated mice (6.05% +/- 0.71%, P < 0.001). (3)
      Morphologic observation showed that pathological changes of the thymocytes and
      liver and lung tissues were remarkably milder in the lanthanum chloride-treated
      mice than in the mice challenged only by LPS. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Lanthanum chloride
      can bind LPS and reduce its toxicity, which shows protective effects on mice
      challenged by lethal dose LPS. (2) Lanthanum chloride can greatly decrease the
      secretion of TNFalpha and TNFalpha mRNA expression in the mice the secretion of
      TNFalpha and TNFalpha mRNA expression in the mice challenged with LPS.
      Furthermore, LPS-induced apoptosis of thymocyte and damage of liver and lungs are
      inhibited by lanthanum chloride.

TI  - Gene regulation: ancient microRNA target sequences in plants.
PG  - 485-6
AB  - MicroRNAs are an abundant class of small RNAs that are thought to regulate the
      expression of protein-coding genes in plants and animals. Here we show that the
      target sequence of two microRNAs, known to regulate genes in the class-III
      homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) gene family of the flowering plant
      Arabidopsis, is conserved in homologous sequences from all lineages of land
      plants, including bryophytes, lycopods, ferns and seed plants. We also find that 
      the messenger RNAs from these genes are cleaved within the same microRNA-binding 
      site in representatives of each land-plant group, as they are in Arabidopsis. Our
      results indicate not only that microRNAs mediate gene regulation in non-flowering
      as well as flowering plants, but also that the regulation of this class of plant 
      genes dates back more than 400 million years.

TI  - Low sensitivity of nested PCR using Plasmodium DNA extracted from stained thick
      blood smears: an epidemiological retrospective study among subjects with low
      parasitaemia in an endemic area of the Brazilian Amazon region.
PG  - 8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The success of PCR technique depends on many factors, such as high
      quality DNA pellets obtained from blood samples, good reagents and adequate
      conditions of amplification. Taking these limitations into account, a
      retrospective epidemiological study for malaria diagnosis was conducted in a
      mesoendemic area in the Brazilian Amazon. METHODS: A nested PCR protocol with DNA
      extracted from two blood storage devices obtained from Giemsa-stained thick blood
      smears and filter-papers was used for malaria diagnosis. The extracted DNA was
      used as a template to amplify approximately 100 bp species-specific sequences of 
      the small subunit of the ribosomal RNA (18S SSU rRNA) of Plasmodium sp. The
      prevalence of single and mixed infections was examined in a cross-sectional
      survey carried out among 369 miners living in the district of Apiacas, Mato
      Grosso State. The parasitemia levels detected by microscopic examination were
      compared to the PCR results. RESULTS: DNA samples isolated from blood on
      filter-paper allowed the detection and identification of Plasmodium in 165
      (44.7%) of the 369 individuals evaluated, while only 62 (16.8%) had positive
      results using DNA obtained from thick smears, a similar rate observed by
      microscopic examination. The sensitivities of PCR using DNA from blood smears and
      filter-papers were 65% and 73.0%, respectively. Low parasite infections (below 20
      parasites/ micro L blood) were not detected when thick blood smears were used as 
      a DNA source. CONCLUSIONS: Although the blood preserved as thick blood smears
      provides an alternative and useful tool for malaria molecular diagnosis, its
      relatively poor performance at low level parasitemias impairs the correct
      determination of malaria prevalence in epidemiological studies. However, the
      results obtained in the present study confirm that the use of filter-paper to
      collect blood is useful for field studies.

TI  - A dynamic role of HAUSP in the p53-Mdm2 pathway.
PG  - 879-86
AB  - Our previous study showed that ubiquitination of p53 is reversible and that the
      ubiquitin hydrolase HAUSP can stabilize p53 by deubiquitination. Here, we found
      that partial reduction of endogenous HAUSP levels by RNAi indeed destabilizes
      endogenous p53; surprisingly, however, nearly complete ablation of HAUSP
      stabilizes and activates p53. We further show that this phenomenon occurs because
      HAUSP stabilizes Mdm2 in a p53-independent manner, providing an interesting
      feedback loop in p53 regulation. Notably, HAUSP is required for Mdm2 stability in
      normal cells; in HAUSP-ablated cells, self-ubiquitinated-Mdm2 becomes extremely
      unstable, leading to indirect p53 activation. Furthermore, this feedback
      regulation is specific to Mdm2; in HeLa cells, where p53 is preferentially
      degraded by viral E6-dependent ubiquitination, depletion of HAUSP fails to
      activate p53. This study provides an example of an ubiquitin ligase (Mdm2) that
      is directly regulated by a deubiquitinase (HAUSP) and also reveals a dynamic role
      of HAUSP in the p53-Mdm2 pathway.

AB  - Magnetic separation is a recent technology using magnetism properties. This
      technology is aimed to purify cells, cell organelles and biologically active
      compounds such as nucleic acids and proteins. Many magnetic separation procedures
      have been developed to isolate cells and molecules. The purpose of this review is
      to give an other view of various methods and strategies which can be employed for
      selection of targets cells and molecules. We describe techniques used to positive
      and negative cells selections, we show that magnetic selection is also aimed to
      perform multiparameter selection or functional selection. Then, we underline
      emerging technology used to select transfected cells and macromolecules such as
      proteins, DNA and RNA.

      applications].
PG  - 139-48
AB  - Since these twenty last years, there is an increasing interest for large-scale
      analysis of biological function. In the field of transcriptome, the emergence of 
      microarray-based technologies and the design of DNA biochips allow
      high-throughput studies of RNA expression in cell and tissue at a given moment.
      In the field of proteome, methods of reference are still the 2D electrophoresis
      followed by analysis with mass spectrometry. Technological progress makes it
      possible to apply microarray methods to proteomics study : they are protein
      biochips or protein arrays. Expression analysis of proteins in a cell or a tissue
      in simultaneous and highly parallel way give further information for large-scale 
      studies of signaling pathway. Numerous applications of protein microarray-based
      assays are described in basic biological research and in medical research to
      identify diagnostic biomarkers of inflammatory and cancerous pathologies and to
      find out news drugs and new therapeutic targets. This review summarizes concrete 
      applications of microarray-based technology in the field of proteome, describes
      fundamental technical stages in protein array development and highlights critical
      points which will be useful to improve this emerging proteomic method.

TI  - Recombinant enzymes from thermophilic micro-organisms expressed in fungal hosts.
PG  - 293-7
AB  - Cost-effective production of enzymes for industrial processes makes the
      appropriate selection of the host/vector expression system critical. We have
      tested two fungal systems for the bulk production of enzymes from thermophiles.
      The yeast Kluyveromyces lactis has been developed as a secretion host employing
      expression vectors based on the 2u-like plasmid pKD1 of Kluyveromyces
      drosophilarium. Our second system involves the filamentous fungus Trichoderma
      reesei. Signal and protein fusion vectors have been constructed using the strong 
      cellobiohydrolase 1 ( cbh1 ) promoter and recombinant plasmid DNAs introduced
      into various high-secreting T. reesei strains using biolistic particle delivery. 
      In some cases (e.g. the xynB gene of Dictyoglomus thermophilum) we have
      reconstructed the genes according to Trichoderma codon preferences and
      demonstrated a dramatic increase in the production of the enzymes. The
      heterologous XynB enzyme is glycosylated differently in different Trichoderma
      strains. A proteomics approach has been taken to identify strongly expressed
      proteins produced by T. reesei under various cultivation conditions in order to
      identify condition-specific promoters driving the production of these proteins.
      Analyses indicated that HEX1, the major protein of the fungal Woronin body, is a 
      dominant protein under both cellulase-inducing and -repressing conditions. The
      hex1 gene together with its promoter and terminator sequences has been isolated
      and the promoter function studied relative to cultivation time and medium.

      micro-organisms.
PG  - 188-92
AB  - Although much attention has been paid to the genetic, biochemical and
      physiological aspects of individual hyperthermophiles, how these unique
      micro-organisms relate to each other and to their natural habitats must be
      addressed in order to develop a comprehensive understanding of life at high
      temperatures. Phylogenetic 16 S rRNA-based profiling of samples from various
      geothermal sites has provided insights into community structure, but this must be
      complemented with efforts to relate metabolic strategies to biotic and abiotic
      characteristics in high-temperature habitats. Described here are functional
      genomics-based approaches, using cDNA microarrays, to gain insight into how
      ecological features such as biofilm formation, species interaction, and possibly 
      even gene transfer may occur in native environments, as well as to determine what
      genes or sets of genes may be tied to environmental functionality.

      enterocyte effacement (LEE)].
PG  - 116-29
AB  - Many bacterial virulence attributes, like toxins, adhesins, invasins, iron uptake
      systems, are encoded within specific regions of the bacterial genome. These in
      size varying regions are termed pathogenicity islands (PAIs) since they confer
      pathogenic properties to the respective micro-organism. Per definition PAIs are
      exclusively found in pathogenic strains and are often inserted near transfer-RNA 
      genes. Nevertheless, non-pathogenic bacteria also possess foreign DNA elements
      that confer advantageous features, leading to improved fitness. These additional 
      DNA elements as well as PAIs are termed genomic islands and were acquired during 
      bacterial evolution. Significant G+C content deviation in pathogenicity islands
      with respect to the rest of the genome, the presence of direct repeat sequences
      at the flanking regions, the presence of integrase gene determinants as other
      mobility features,the particular insertion site (tRNA gene) as well as the
      observed genetic instability suggests that pathogenicity islands were acquired by
      horizontal gene transfer. PAIs are the fascinating proof of the plasticity of
      bacterial genomes. PAIs were originally described in human pathogenic Escherichia
      (E.) coli strains. In the meantime PAIs have been found in various pathogenic
      bacteria of humans, animals and even plants. The Locus of Enterocyte Effacement
      (LEE) is one particular widely distributed PAI of E coli. In addition, it also
      confers pathogenicity to the related species Citrobacter (C.) rodentium and
      Escherichia (E.) alvei. The LEE is an important virulence feature of several
      animal pathogens. It is an obligate PAI of all animal and human enteropathogenic 
      E. coli (EPEC), and most enterohaemorrhegic E. coli (EHEC) also harbor the LEE.
      The LEE encodes a type III secretion system, an adhesion (intimin) that mediates 
      the intimate contact between the bacterium and the epithelial cell, as well as
      various proteins which are secreted via the type III secretion system. The LEE
      encoded virulence features are responsible for the formation of so called
      attaching and effacing (AE) lesions in the intestinal epithelium. Due to its wide
      distribution in animal pathogens, LEE encoded antigens are suitable vaccine
      antigens. Acquisition and structure of the LEE pathogenicity island is the
      crucial point of numerous investigations. However, the evolution of the LEE, its 
      origin and further spread in E. coli, are far from being resolved.

TI  - Core I gene is overexpressed in Hurthle and non-Hurthle cell microfollicular
      adenomas and follicular carcinomas of the thyroid.
PG  - 12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most of the steps involved in the initiation and progression of
      Hurthle (oncocytic, oxyphilic) cell carcinomas of the thyroid remain unknown.
      METHODS: Using differential display and semiquantitative RT-PCR we found, among
      other alterations, overexpression of the gene encoding the Core I subunit of the 
      complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in a follicular carcinoma
      composed of Hurthle cells. RESULTS: Similar high levels of Core I gene expression
      were detected in nine follicular carcinomas (seven with Hurthle cell features),
      in seven microfollicular adenomas (one with Hurthle cell features) and in one
      micro/macrofollicular adenoma, in contrast to a lower/normal expression in nine
      papillary carcinomas (three with Hurthle cell features) and five macrofollicular 
      adenomas (one of which displaying Hurthle cell features). No significative
      correlation was found between Core I overexpression and the proliferative
      activity of the lesions. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that Core I overexpression in
      thyroid tumours is not associated with malignancy, Hurthle cells or proliferative
      activity. The pathogenetic mechanism linking Core I overexpression to the
      microfollicular pattern of growth of thyroid tumours remains to be clarified.

TI  - Premature termination codons do not affect the rate of splicing of neighboring
      introns.
PG  - 657-68
AB  - Introduction of a premature termination codon (PTC) into an exon of a gene can
      lead to nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA, which is best characterized as a
      cytoplasmic event. However, increasing evidence has suggested that PTCs may also 
      influence the nuclear processing of an RNA transcript, leading to models of
      nuclear surveillance perhaps involving translating nuclear ribosomes. We used
      quantitative RT-PCR to measure the in vivo steady-state levels of every
      exon-intron junction in wild-type, PTC-containing, and missense-containing
      precursor mRNAs of both the nonrearranging dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and the
      somatically rearranging Ig- micro genes. We find that each exon-intron junction's
      abundance and, therefore, the rate of intron removal, is not significantly
      affected by the presence of a PTC in a neighboring exon in either the DHFR or Ig-
      micro pre-mRNA. Similarly, the abundance of the uncleaved Ig- micro
      polyadenylation sites does not differ between wild-type and PTC-containing Ig-
      micro pre-mRNAs. Our Ig- micro data were confirmed by RNase protection analyses, 
      and multiple cell isolates were examined to resolve differences with previously
      published data on steady-state pre-mRNA levels. We conclude that the presence of 
      a PTC affects the rate of neither splicing nor the cleavage step of 3' end
      formation during pre-mRNA processing in the nucleus. Our results are discussed
      with respect to existing evidence for nuclear surveillance mechanisms.

TI  - A small modulatory dsRNA specifies the fate of adult neural stem cells.
PG  - 779-93
AB  - Discovering the molecular mechanisms that regulate neuron-specific gene
      expression remains a central challenge for CNS research. Here, we report that
      small, noncoding double-stranded (ds) RNAs play a critical role in mediating
      neuronal differentiation. The sequence defined by this dsRNA is NRSE/RE1, which
      is recognized by NRSF/REST, known primarily as a negative transcriptional
      regulator that restricts neuronal gene expression to neurons. The NRSE dsRNA can 
      trigger gene expression of neuron-specific genes through interaction with
      NRSF/REST transcriptional machinery, resulting in the transition from neural stem
      cells with neuron-specific genes silenced by NRSF/REST into cells with neuronal
      identity that can express neuronal genes. The mechanism of action appears to be
      mediated through a dsRNA/protein interaction, rather than through siRNA or miRNA.
      The discovery of small modulatory dsRNAs (smRNAs) extends the important
      contribution of noncoding RNAs as key regulators of cell behavior at both
      transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels.

TI  - HIV-specific cellular immune response is inversely correlated with disease
      progression as defined by decline of CD4+ T cells in relation to HIV RNA load.
PG  - 1199-208
AB  - The average time between infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and
      development of acquired immune deficiency syndrome is approximately 8 years.
      However, progression rates vary widely, depending on several determinants,
      including HIV-specific immunity, host genetic factors, and virulence of the
      infecting strain. In untreated HIV-infected patients with different progression
      rates, we examined HIV-specific T cell responses in combination with host genetic
      markers, such as chemokine/chemokine-receptor (CCR) polymorphisms and human
      leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes. HIV-specific CD4(+) T cell responses and, to a
      lesser extent, HIV-specific CD8(+) T cell responses were inversely correlated
      with progression rate. Slower progression was not related to polymorphisms in CCR
      genes, HLA genotype, or GB virus C coinfection. These data suggest that
      HIV-specific T cell responses are involved in protecting the host from disease
      progression.

TI  - Treatment of recurrent hepatitis C after liver transplantation: a pilot study of 
      peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combination.
PG  - 669-74
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: After liver transplantation (LT) for HCV-related cirrhosis,
      recurrence of HCV infection is universal and the risk of progression to cirrhosis
      is high. The modalities and efficacy of antiviral therapy in this indication are 
      still controversial. We present here the results of a pilot study of a 12-month
      combination therapy by pegylated alfa 2b-interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin in 20
      patients. METHODS: Twenty patients entered the study (13 male and 7 female,
      median age 53.8 years). In 80% of patients, HCV infection was of genotype 1. The 
      delay between LT and antiviral therapy was 28 months. The doses were
      progressively increased from 0.5 to 1 micro g/kg/week for PEG-IFN and from 400 to
      1000-1200 mg/d for ribavirin. Follow-up was based on biochemical (ALT),
      virological (HCV-RNA) and histological (liver biopsy) examinations. RESULTS: Four
      patients (20%) were withdrawn due to adverse effects. In 6 patients the dose of
      PEG-IFN had to be reduced to 0.5 micro g/kg/week. A reduction in the dose of
      ribavirin in 13/16 cases was due to the onset of anemia. Histological evidence of
      mild acute rejection increased the immunosuppressive regimen in 5/20 patients. At
      the end of the treatment, 75% of the patients had a biochemical response and 55% 
      a virological response. The mean METAVIR score, according to activity and
      fibrosis, was A1.8 F2.2 before treatment and A0.3 F1.6 at the end of treatment.
      In 9/20 patients, virological response persisted 6 months after the end of the
      treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that combination therapy by PEG-IFN
      and ribavirin may be well tolerated and beneficial during recurrent hepatitis C
      in liver transplant recipients.

TI  - Comparative study of PM2.5 - and PM10 - induced oxidative stress in rat lung
      epithelial cells.
PG  - 11-8
AB  - Accurate estimation of the exposure-response relationship between ambient urban
      particulate matters (PM) and public health is important for regulatory
      perspective of ambient urban particulate matters (PM). Ambient PM contains
      various transition metals and organic compounds. PM10 (aerodynamic diameter less 
      than 10 micro m) is known to induce diverse diseases such as chronic cough,
      bronchitis, chest illness, etc. However, recent evaluation of PM2.5 (aerodynamic 
      diameter less than 2.5 micro m) against health outcomes has suggested that the
      fine particles may be more closely associated with adverse respiratory health
      effects than particles of larger size. This study was performed to evaluate
      PM2.5-induced oxidative stress in rat lung epithelial cell in order to provide
      basic data for the risk assessment of PM2.5. PM2.5 showed higher cytotoxicity
      than PM10. Also, PM 2.5 induced more malondialdehyde (MDA) formation than PM10.
      In Hoechst 33258 dye staining and DNA fragmentation assay, apopotic changes were 
      clearly detected in PM2.5 treated cells in compared to PM10. Expression of
      catalase mRNA was increased by PM2.5 rather than PM10. PM2.5 induced higher Mth1 
      mRNA than PM10. In pBR322 DNA treated with PM2.5, production of single strand
      breakage of DNA was higher than that of PM10. In Western blot analysis, PM2.5
      induced more Nrf-2 protein, associated with diverse transcriptional and
      anti-oxidative stress enzymes, compared to PM10. Our data suggest that PM2.5
      rather than PM10 may be responsible for PM-induced toxicity. Additional efforts
      are needed to establish the environmental standard of PM2.5.

TI  - Cr(VI) reduction in a chromate-resistant strain of Candida maltosa isolated from 
      the leather industry.
PG  - 63-8
AB  - A Cr(VI)-resistant yeast was isolated from tanning liquors from a leather factory
      in Leon, Guanajuato, Mexico. Based on morphological and physiological analyses
      and the D1/D2 domain sequence of the 26S rDNA, the yeast was identified as
      Candida maltosa. Resistance of the strain to high Cr(VI) concentrations and its
      ability to chemically reduce chromium was studied. When compared to the three
      laboratory yeasts Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia
      lipolytica, the C. maltosa strain was found to tolerate chromate concentrations
      as high as 100 micro g/ml. In addition to this phenotypic trait, the C. maltosa
      strain showed ability to reduce Cr(VI). Chromate reduction occurred both in
      intact cells (grown in culture medium or in soil containing chromate) as well as 
      in cell-free extracts. NADH-dependent chromate reductase activity was found
      associated with soluble protein and, to a lesser extent, with the membrane
      fraction.

TI  - Intracellular lipid accumulation, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related
      protein expression, and cell survival in vascular smooth muscle cells derived
      from normal and atherosclerotic human coronaries.
PG  - 182-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) regulation during atherosclerotic 
      plaque progression is determinant for plaque stability. AIMS: To study lipid
      accumulation, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) expression, 
      and cell survival in VSMCs isolated from nonatherosclerotic areas (normal VSMCs) 
      and advanced atherosclerotic plaques (plaque-VSMCs) of human coronaries. DESIGN: 
      Normal or plaque-VSMCs were obtained from the intima by modification of the
      explant technique. RESULTS: Aggregated low-density lipoprotein (agLDL) (100 micro
      g mL(-1)) internalization induced higher intracellular cholesteryl ester (CE)
      accumulation in plaque-VSMC compared with normal VSMCs (89.28 +/- 6.1 vs. 60.34
      +/- 4.1 micro g CE mg(-1) of protein; P < 0.05). This internalization was
      associated with LRP expression, as plaque-VSMCs show higher levels of LRP mRNA
      (6.06 +/- 0.55 vs. 3.87 +/- 0.28; P < 0.05) and LRP protein expression than
      normal VSMCs. However, plaque-VSMCs showed a lower proliferative response than
      normal VSMCs (6536 +/- 636 vs. 11151 +/- 815 c.p.m. [(3)H]thymidine; P < 0.05)
      and did not respond to platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) stimulus. In
      agreement, the Bcl(2)/BAX ratio was significantly lower in plaque-VSMCs compared 
      with normal VSMCs (0.14 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.51 +/- 0.07; P < 0.05) and it was
      independent of lipid loading. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that higher
      intracellular lipid deposition in plaque-VSMCs is related to higher LRP
      expression levels. However, LRP-mediated agLDL internalization is not directly
      related to the reduced survival of plaque-VSMCs.

TI  - Human articular chondrocytes, synoviocytes and synovial microvessels express
      aquaporin water channels; upregulation of AQP1 in rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 435-44
AB  - Recent studies have shown that aquaporin water channels are expressed in human
      Meckel's cartilage. The aim of the present investigation was to determine if
      human articular chondrocytes and synoviocytes express aquaporin 1 (AQP1) water
      channels and to establish if there are any alterations in AQP1 expression in
      osteoarticular disorders such as osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA). Immunohistochemistry was employed semi-quantitatively to compare the
      expression of AQP1 in human chondrocytes derived from normal, OA and RA joints.
      PCR, cloning and sequencing confirmed the presence of AQP1 transcripts in
      chondrocytes. Normal human tissue microarrays including samples of kidney,
      choroid plexus and pancreas were used as positive controls for AQP1 expression.
      In most tissues AQP1 was expressed along endothelial barriers. In the kidney AQP1
      was present in the glomerular capillary endothelium, proximal tubule and
      descending thin limbs. AQP1 was also localized to pancreatic ducts and acini and 
      the apical membrane domain of the choroid plexus. Immunohistochemistry showed
      that AQP1 is expressed in synovial micro-vessels, synoviocytes and predominantly 
      in chondrocytes located in the deep zone of articular cartilage. Image analysis
      of normal, OA and RA cartilage suggested that AQP1 may be upregulated in RA. This
      is the first report of AQP1 mRNA and protein expression in articular chondrocytes
      and synoviocytes. These findings suggest a potential role for AQP1 and possibly
      other members of the AQP gene family in the movement of extracellular matrix and 
      metabolic water across the membranes of chondrocytes and synoviocytes for the
      purposes of chondrocyte volume regulation and synovial homeostasis.

TI  - Genetic and functional diversification of small RNA pathways in plants.
PG  - E104
AB  - Multicellular eukaryotes produce small RNA molecules (approximately 21-24
      nucleotides) of two general types, microRNA (miRNA) and short interfering RNA
      (siRNA). They collectively function as sequence-specific guides to silence or
      regulate genes, transposons, and viruses and to modify chromatin and genome
      structure. Formation or activity of small RNAs requires factors belonging to gene
      families that encode DICER (or DICER-LIKE [DCL]) and ARGONAUTE proteins and, in
      the case of some siRNAs, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) proteins. Unlike many
      animals, plants encode multiple DCL and RDR proteins. Using a series of insertion
      mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana, unique functions for three DCL proteins in miRNA
      (DCL1), endogenous siRNA (DCL3), and viral siRNA (DCL2) biogenesis were
      identified. One RDR protein (RDR2) was required for all endogenous siRNAs
      analyzed. The loss of endogenous siRNA in dcl3 and rdr2 mutants was associated
      with loss of heterochromatic marks and increased transcript accumulation at some 
      loci. Defects in siRNA-generation activity in response to turnip crinkle virus in
      dcl2 mutant plants correlated with increased virus susceptibility. We conclude
      that proliferation and diversification of DCL and RDR genes during evolution of
      plants contributed to specialization of small RNA-directed pathways for
      development, chromatin structure, and defense.

TI  - Sequence-specific inhibition of small RNA function.
PG  - E98
AB  - Hundreds of microRNAs (miRNAs) and endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)
      have been identified from both plants and animals, yet little is known about
      their biochemical modes of action or biological functions. Here we report that
      2'-O-methyl oligonucleotides can act as irreversible, stoichiometric inhibitors
      of small RNA function. We show that a 2'-O-methyl oligonucleotide complementary
      to an siRNA can block mRNA cleavage in Drosophila embryo lysates and HeLa cell
      S100 extracts and in cultured human HeLa cells. In Caenorhabditis elegans,
      injection of the 2'-O-methyl oligonucleotide complementary to the miRNA let-7 can
      induce a let-7 loss-of-function phenocopy. Using an immobilized 2'-O-methyl
      oligonucleotide, we show that the C. elegans Argonaute proteins ALG-1 and ALG-2, 
      which were previously implicated in let-7 function through genetic studies, are
      constituents of a let-7-containing protein-RNA complex. Thus, we demonstrate that
      2'-O-methyl RNA oligonucleotides can provide an efficient and straightforward way
      to block small RNA function in vivo and furthermore can be used to identify small
      RNA-associated proteins that mediate RNA silencing pathways.

      converted to cDNA and processed with restriction endonucleases to generate
      low-complexity pools (approximately 80-120) of equal length DNA fragments. The
      resulting material is amplified and detected with the UMAS system, comprising all
      possible 4,096 (4(6)) DNA hexamers. Ligation to the arrays yields thousands of
      14-mer sequence tags. The compendium of signals from all pools in the
      array-of-universal arrays comprises a full-transcriptome expression profile. The 
      technology was validated by analysis of the galactose response of Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae, and the resulting profiles showed excellent agreement with the
      literature and real-time PCR assays. The technology was also used to demonstrate 
      expression profiling from a hybrid organism in a proof-of-concept experiment
      where a T-cell receptor gene was expressed in yeast.

AB  - A novel hyperthermophilic archaeon, designated strain SY1(T), was isolated from a
      deep-sea hydrothermal vent chimney sample collected from the Suiyo Seamount in
      the Izu-Bonin Arc, Japan, at a depth of 1385 m. The cells were irregular cocci
      (1.2 to 2.1 micro m in diameter), occurring singly or in pairs, and stained
      Gram-negative. Growth was observed between 70 and 97 degrees C (optimum, 85
      degrees C; 220 min doubling time), pH 6.5 and 8.8 (optimum, pH 8.0), and salinity
      of 2.2 and 5.3 % (optimum, 3.5 %). It was a strictly aerobic heterotroph capable 
      of growing on complex proteinaceous substrates such as yeast extract and
      tryptone. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 54.4 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis
      based on the 16S rDNA sequence of the isolate indicated that the isolate was
      closely related to Aeropyrum pernix strain K1(T). However, no significant genetic
      relatedness was observed between them by DNA-DNA hybridization. On the basis of
      the molecular and physiological traits of the new isolate, the name Aeropyrum
      camini sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain SY1(T) (=JCM 12091(T)=ATCC
      BAA-758(T)).

TI  - Identification of 20 microRNAs from Oryza sativa.
PG  - 1688-95
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are present in both plant and animal kingdoms and represents a
      growing family of non-coding RNAs. These tiny RNAs act as small guides and direct
      negative regulations usually in the process of development through sequence
      complementarity to target mRNAs. Although a large number of miRNAs have been
      identified from various animals, so far plant miRNA studies have focused mainly
      on Arabidopsis. Here we describe the identification of 20 miRNAs from a rice cDNA
      library. All the miRNAs were presumably processed from precursors with stem-loop 
      structures and were positively detected in rice cells from at least one tissue,
      some of which showed tissue-specific expression. Twenty-three unique rice genes
      were identified to be feasible targets for seven rice miRNAs, including four
      members of Scarecrow-like transcription factor, the targets of miR-39 that had
      been characterized in Arabidopsis. Lacking long complementarity, the regulatory
      targets of 13 miRNAs remain to be further investigated. A possible mechanism of
      translational repressor for plant miRNAs that lack perfect complementarity to
      target mRNAs is discussed.

TI  - Genetic analysis of RNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing.
PG  - 129-41
AB  - The 'nuclear side' of RNA interference (RNAi) is increasingly recognized as an
      integral part of RNA-mediated gene silencing networks. Current data are
      consistent with the idea that epigenetic changes, such as DNA (cytosine-5)
      methylation and histone modifications, can be targeted to identical DNA sequences
      by short RNAs derived via Dicer cleavage of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). To
      determine the relationships among RNA signals, DNA methylation and chromatin
      structure, we are carrying out a genetic analysis of RNA-mediated transcriptional
      gene silencing (TGS) in Arabidopsis. Results obtained so far indicate that in
      response to RNA signals, different site-specific DNA methyltransferases (DMTases)
      cooperate with each other and eventually with histone-modifying enzymes to
      establish and maintain a transcriptionally inactive state at a homologous target 
      promoter. Processing of dsRNA in Arabidopsis occurs in the nucleus and in the
      cytoplasm, where distinct Dicer-like (DCL) activities are thought to generate
      functionally distinct classes of short RNAs. RNA silencing pathways thus operate 
      throughout the cell to defend against invasive nucleic acids and to regulate
      genome structure and function.

TI  - Monitoring RNA release from human rhinovirus by dynamic force microscopy.
PG  - 3203-9
AB  - Human rhinoviruses were imaged under physiological conditions by dynamic force
      microscopy. Topographical images revealed various polygonal areas on the surfaces
      of the 30-nm viral particles. RNA release was initiated by exposure to a low-pH
      buffer. The lengths of the RNAs that were released but still connected to the
      virus capsid varied between 40 and 330 nm, whereas RNA molecules that were
      completely released from the virus were observed with lengths up to 1 micro m.
      Fork-like structure elements with 30-nm extensions were sometimes resolved at one
      end of the RNA molecules. They possibly correspond to the characteristic
      multi-stem-loop conformation, the internal ribosomal entry site, located at the
      5' region of the genome. This study demonstrates that dynamic force microscopy
      can be used to study viral RNA release in situ under physiological conditions.

TI  - Specificity of microRNA target selection in translational repression.
PG  - 504-11
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNAs found in organisms as
      evolutionarily distant as plants and mammals, yet most of the mRNAs they regulate
      are unknown. Here we show that the ability of an miRNA to translationally repress
      a target mRNA is largely dictated by the free energy of binding of the first
      eight nucleotides in the 5' region of the miRNA. However, G:U wobble base-pairing
      in this region interferes with activity beyond that predicted on the basis of
      thermodynamic stability. Furthermore, an mRNA can be simultaneously repressed by 
      more than one miRNA species. The level of repression achieved is dependent on
      both the amount of mRNA and the amount of available miRNA complexes. Thus,
      predicted miRNA:mRNA interactions must be viewed in the context of other
      potential interactions and cellular conditions.

TI  - Computational identification of microRNA targets.
PG  - 529-35
AB  - Recent experiments have shown that the genomes of organisms such as worm, fly,
      human, and mouse encode hundreds of microRNA genes. Many of these microRNAs are
      thought to regulate the translational expression of other genes by binding to
      partially complementary sites in messenger RNAs. Phenotypic and expression
      analysis suggests an important role of microRNAs during development. Therefore,
      it is of fundamental importance to identify microRNA targets. However, no
      experimental or computational high-throughput method for target site
      identification in animals has been published yet. Our main result is a new
      computational method that is designed to identify microRNA target sites. This
      method recovers with high specificity known microRNA target sites that have
      previously been defined experimentally. Based on these results, we present a
      simple model for the mechanism of microRNA target site recognition. Our model
      incorporates both kinetic and thermodynamic components of target recognition.
      When we applied our method to a set of 74 Drosophila melanogaster microRNAs,
      searching 3'UTR sequences of a predefined set of fly mRNAs for target sites which
      were evolutionary conserved between D. melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura,
      we found that many key developmental body patterning genes such as hairy and
      fushi-tarazu are likely to be translationally regulated by microRNAs.

TI  - MOR1 receptor mRNA expression in human brains of drug-related fatalities-a
      real-time PCR quantification.
PG  - 13-20
AB  - The expression of the human micro-opiate receptor (MOR1) in post mortem human
      brain tissue was examined using real-time PCR technology. Tissue samples from 11 
      fatalities due to opiate overdose and five normal subjects with different causes 
      of death were analysed in order to elucidate whether chronic opiate abuse is
      followed by a regulation of MOR1 expression. In each case nine selected brain
      regions (thalamus, caudate nucleus, hypothalamus, ventral tegmentum, hippocampus,
      amygdala, frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, putamen) were evaluated. The
      MOR1-mRNA level was determined relative to the housekeeping gene
      beta2-microglobulin. While in most regions the MOR mRNA levels in the brain of
      addicts were not different from the control group-with varying levels between 0
      and 15% of housekeeping gene level-in the brains of three drug-related fatalities
      an enormous increase was encountered in the thalamus where the MOR-mRNA level
      amounted for up to 10,000% of the measured housekeeping gene level. The results
      obtained by toxicological hair analysis in the group of drug-related fatalities
      indicate that the enormous thalamic MOR1-expression is primarily found in
      individuals who died from acute heroin overdose but did not show signs of a
      substantial chronic administration of the drug. Further studies have to be
      performed to evaluate if the observed MOR1-mRNA up-regulation in the thalamus in 
      a subpopulation of acute lethal intoxications mirrors a state of functional
      hypersensitivity associated with the occurrence of death.

TI  - Increased expression of endothelin-converting enzyme-1c isoform in response to
      high glucose levels in endothelial cells.
PG  - 131-40
AB  - Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is both a potent vasoconstrictor and mitogenic factor that
      has been implicated as a cause of the micro- and macrovascular complications of
      diabetes mellitus. The pathway by which the high-glucose environment of diabetes 
      mediates increased levels of endothelins has not been completely elucidated but
      appears to involve endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE-1), which converts inactive 
      big ET-1 to active ET-1 peptide. To determine the effect of high glucose
      concentrations on the expression of ECE-1, hybrid endothelial cells (EA.hy926)
      and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were both grown in various
      glucose concentrations. There was a 2-fold increase in ECE-1 immunoreactivity in 
      the EA.hy926 cell line growing in medium containing 22.2 versus 5.5 mmol/l
      glucose after 24 h, which rose to greater than 20-fold after 5 days. Similar
      results were seen with HUVEC. Bradykinin or NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester did 
      not change the effect of high glucose on ECE-1 protein expression. High glucose
      induced a 72 and 41% increase in total protein kinase C (PKC) activity in both
      EA.hy926 cells and HUVEC, respectively, and a 39, 49 and 109% elevation in PKC
      beta1, beta2 and delta expression, respectively, in EA.hy926 cells. The increase 
      in ECE-1 expression was inhibited in both cell cultures by GF109203X (5
      micromol/l), a general PKC inhibitor, while addition of 10 nmol/l phorbol
      myristic acid to EA.hy926 cells or HUVEC growing on medium containing 5.5 mmol/l 
      glucose increased ECE-1 expression to a level similar to that of cells
      conditioned in high glucose. Human ECE-1 protein exists in four different
      isoforms, termed 1a, 1b, 1c and 1d. Northern blot analysis revealed that only
      ECE-1c isoform mRNA levels increased. Immunohistochemical staining of EA.hy926
      cells grown in high glucose concentrations demonstrated an increase in the ECE-1c
      isoform, which occurred mainly in the plasma membrane. These results showed that 
      the PKC pathway may play an important role in the glucose-mediated induction of
      ECE-1 expression. The main isoform to increase in response to high glucose was
      ECE-1c. This enzyme may be one of the factors contributing to the elevated ET-1
      peptide levels observed in diabetes.

TI  - Quantification of gene expression in methanotrophs by competitive reverse
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
PG  - 388-99
AB  - To improve the monitoring of methanotrophic activity, a competitive reverse
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methodology was developed.
      Homologous internal RNA standards were created for mmoX and pmoA, genes encoding 
      polypeptides of sMMO and pMMO, respectively. Using specific primer sets,
      expression of sMMO and pMMO could be quantified by means of competitive RT-PCR
      and capillary electrophoresis with uncoated bare-fused silica columns and UV
      detection. Using this technique, it was discovered that the amount of mRNA
      transcript for both mmoX and pmoA correlated well with whole-cell sMMO and pMMO
      activity respectively. A method for soil RNA extraction was also developed to
      utilize this RNA quantification technique for the monitoring of methanotrophic
      activity in situ. In a model soil slurry system with a background concentration
      of 2.9 micro M copper, it was found that only pmoA was transcribed by cells
      capable of expressing both forms of MMO. As pMMO and sMMO have very different
      substrate ranges and kinetics, this methodology may prove useful for optimizing
      in situ bioremediation by methanotrophs. Provided sufficient sequence information
      is available to create specific primer sets, these techniques can be applied for 
      monitoring and measuring the activity of other microbial communities in situ.

TI  - Polymer microfluidic chip for online monitoring of microarray hybridizations.
PG  - 28-37
AB  - A disposable single use polymer microfluidics chip has been developed and
      manufactured by micro injection molding. The chip has the same outer dimensions
      as a standard microscope slide (25 x 76 x 1.1 mm) and is designed to be
      compatible with existing microscope slide handling equipment like microarray
      scanners. The chip contains an inlet, a 10 microL hybridization chamber capable
      of holding a 1000 spot array, a waste chamber and a vent to allow air to escape
      when sample is injected. The hybridization chamber ensures highly homogeneous
      hybridization conditions across the microarray. We describe the use of this chip 
      in a flexible setup with fluorescence based detection, temperature control and
      liquid handling by computer controlled syringe pumps. The chip and the setup
      presented in this article provide a powerful tool for highly parallel studies of 
      kinetics and thermodynamics of duplex formation in DNA microarrays. The
      experimental setup presented in this article enables the on-chip microarray to be
      hybridized and monitored at several different stringency conditions during a
      single assay. The performance of the chip and the setup is demonstrated by
      on-line measurements of a hybridization of a DNA target solution to a microarray.
      A presented numerical model indicates that the hybridization process in
      microfluidic hybridization assays is diffusion limited, due to the low values of 
      the diffusion coefficients D of the DNA and RNA molecules involved.

PG  - 1847-51
AB  - The response of Desulfovibrio vulgaris to Cu(II) and Hg(II) was characterized.
      Both metals increased the lag phase, and Cu(II) reduced cell yield at
      concentrations as low as 50 microM. mRNA expression was analyzed using random
      arbitrarily primed PCR, differential display, and quantitative PCR. Both Cu(II)
      and Hg(II) (50 micro M) caused upregulation of mRNA expression for an ATP binding
      protein (ORF2004) and an ATPase (ORF856) with four- to sixfold increases for
      Hg(II) and 1.4- to 3-fold increases with Cu(II). These results suggest that D.
      vulgaris uses an ATP-dependent mechanism for adapting to toxic metals in the
      environment.

TI  - Description of Treponema azotonutricium sp. nov. and Treponema primitia sp. nov.,
      the first spirochetes isolated from termite guts.
PG  - 1315-20
AB  - Long after their original discovery, termite gut spirochetes were recently
      isolated in pure culture for the first time. They revealed metabolic capabilities
      hitherto unknown in the Spirochaetes division of the Bacteria, i.e., H(2) plus
      CO(2) acetogenesis (J. R. Leadbetter, T. M. Schmidt, J. R. Graber, and J. A.
      Breznak, Science 283:686-689, 1999) and dinitrogen fixation (T. G. Lilburn, K. S.
      Kim, N. E. Ostrom, K. R. Byzek, J. R. Leadbetter, and J. A. Breznak, Science
      292:2495-2498, 2001). However, application of specific epithets to the strains
      isolated (Treponema strains ZAS-1, ZAS-2, and ZAS-9) was postponed pending a more
      complete characterization of their phenotypic properties. Here we describe the
      major properties of strain ZAS-9, which is readily distinguished from strains
      ZAS-1 and ZAS-2 by its shorter mean cell wavelength or body pitch (1.1 versus 2.3
      micro m), by its nonhomoacetogenic fermentation of carbohydrates to acetate,
      ethanol, H(2), and CO(2), and by 7 to 8% dissimilarity between its 16S rRNA
      sequence and those of ZAS-1 and ZAS-2. Strain ZAS-9 is proposed as the type
      strain of the new species, Treponema azotonutricium. Strains ZAS-1 and ZAS-2,
      which are H(2)-consuming, CO(2)-reducing homoacetogens, are proposed here to be
      two strains of the new species Treponema primitia. Apart from the salient
      differences mentioned above, the genomes of all three strains were similar in
      size (3,461 to 3,901 kb), in G+C content (50.0 to 51.0 mol%), and in possession
      of 2 copies of the gene encoding 16S rRNA (rrs). For comparison, the genome of
      the free-living spirochete Spirochaeta aurantia strain J1 was analyzed by the
      same methods and found to have a size of 3,719 kb, to contain 65.6 mol% G+C, and 
      also to possess 2 copies of the rrs gene.

TI  - Development of a real-time PCR assay for detection of Plasmodium falciparum,
      Plasmodium vivax, and Plasmodium ovale for routine clinical diagnosis.
PG  - 1214-9
AB  - A TaqMan-based real-time PCR qualitative assay for the detection of three species
      of malaria parasites-Plasmodium falciparum, P. ovale, and P. vivax-was devised
      and evaluated using 122 whole-blood samples from patients who had traveled to
      areas where malaria is endemic and who presented with malaria-like symptoms and
      fever. The assay was compared to conventional microscopy and to an established
      nested-PCR assay. The specificity of the new assay was confirmed by sequencing
      the PCR products from all the positive samples and by the lack of
      cross-reactivity with Toxoplasma gondii and Leishmania infantum DNA. Real-time
      PCR assay showed a detection limit (analytical sensitivity) of 0.7, 4, and 1.5
      parasites/ micro l for P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. ovale, respectively.
      Real-time PCR, like nested PCR, brought to light errors in the species
      identification by microscopic examination and revealed the presence of mixed
      infections (P. falciparum plus P. ovale). Real-time PCR can yield results within 
      2 h, does not require post-PCR processing, reduces sample handling, and minimizes
      the risks of contamination. The assay can therefore be easily implemented in
      routine diagnostic malaria tests. Future studies are warranted to investigate the
      clinical value of this technique.

TI  - MicroRNAs: something important between the genes.
PG  - 120-5
AB  - Non-coding small endogenous RNAs, of 21-24 nucleotides in length, have recently
      emerged as important regulators of gene expression in both plants and animals. At
      least three categories of small RNAs exist in plants: short interfering RNAs
      (siRNAs) deriving from viruses or transgenes and mediating virus resistance or
      transgene silencing via RNA degradation; siRNAs deriving from transposons or
      transgene promoters and controlling transposon and transgene silencing probably
      via chromatin changes; and microRNAs (miRNAs) deriving from intergenic regions of
      the genome and regulating the expression of endogenous genes either by mRNA
      cleavage or translational repression. The disruption of miRNA-mediated regulation
      causes developmental abnormalities in plants, demonstrating that miRNAs play an
      important role in the regulation of developmental decisions.

TI  - Expression profiling of mammalian microRNAs uncovers a subset of brain-expressed 
      microRNAs with possible roles in murine and human neuronal differentiation.
PG  - R13
AB  - BACKGROUND: The microRNAs (miRNAs) are an extensive class of small noncoding RNAs
      (18 to 25 nucleotides) with probable roles in the regulation of gene expression. 
      In Caenorhabditis elegans, lin-4 and let-7 miRNAs control the timing of fate
      specification of neuronal and hypodermal cells during larval development. lin-4, 
      let-7 and other miRNA genes are conserved in mammals, and their potential
      functions in mammalian development are under active study. RESULTS: In order to
      identify mammalian miRNAs that might function in development, we characterized
      the expression of 119 previously reported miRNAs in adult organs from mouse and
      human using northern blot analysis. Of these, 30 miRNAs were specifically
      expressed or greatly enriched in a particular organ (brain, lung, liver or
      skeletal muscle). This suggests organ- or tissue-specific functions for miRNAs.
      To test if any of the 66 brain-expressed miRNAs were present in neurons,
      embryonal carcinoma cells were treated with all-trans-retinoic acid to promote
      neuronal differentiation. A total of 19 brain-expressed miRNAs (including lin-4
      and let-7 orthologs) were coordinately upregulated in both human and mouse
      embryonal carcinoma cells during neuronal differentiation. The mammalian ortholog
      of C. elegans lin-28, which is downregulated by lin-4 in worms via 3'
      untranslated region binding, was also repressed during neuronal differentiation
      of mammalian embryonal carcinoma cells. Mammalian lin-28 messenger RNAs contain
      conserved predicted binding sites in their 3' untranslated regions for
      neuron-expressed miR-125b (a lin-4 ortholog), let-7a, and miR-218. CONCLUSIONS:
      The identification of a subset of brain-expressed miRNAs whose expression
      behavior is conserved in both mouse and human differentiating neurons implicates 
      these miRNAs in mammalian neuronal development or function.

TI  - Expression of the novel adrenocorticotropin-responsive gene selective Alzheimer's
      disease indicator-1 in the normal adrenal cortex and in adrenocortical adenomas
      and carcinomas.
PG  - 1332-9
AB  - Selective Alzheimer's disease indicator-1 (seladin-1) is a novel gene with
      antiapoptotic activity that is down-regulated in vulnerable brain regions in
      Alzheimer's disease. This gene encodes 3-beta-hydroxysterol Delta-24-reductase
      (DHCR24), which converts desmosterol into cholesterol. In the adrenal cortex,
      increased expression of seladin-1/DHCR24, which appears to be modulated by ACTH, 
      has been recently reported in cortisol-secreting adenomas, compared with the
      adjacent atrophic tissue. In our study, we measured the expression level of
      seladin-1/DHCR24 in cortisol- (n = 18) and aldosterone-secreting (n = 16)
      adrenocortical adenomas, in carcinomas (n = 17), and in normal adrenal glands (n 
      = 8) by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The amount of seladin-1/DHCR24 mRNA was
      significantly reduced in carcinomas (total RNA, 2.5 +/- 0.8 pg/ micro g) compared
      with the other groups (P < 0.01). Western blot analysis confirmed the mRNA
      results. Similarly, in adrenal malignancies, significantly reduced levels of
      expression of the ACTH receptor gene were found. In the adrenal cancer cell line 
      H295R and in primary cultures from adrenocortical cells, ACTH (1 nM) and
      forskolin (10 micro M) effectively increased seladin-1/DHCR24 expression,
      confirming that seladin-1/DHCR24 is modulated by the ACTH/cAMP-driven pathway. In
      summary, this is the first demonstration that seladin-1/DHCR24 expression is
      reduced in adrenal cancer, suggesting that it might be viewed as a new potential 
      marker of adrenal malignancies.

TI  - microRNA-mediated repression of rolled leaf1 specifies maize leaf polarity.
PG  - 84-8
AB  - In both animals and plants, many developmentally important regulatory genes have 
      complementary microRNAs (miRNAs), which suggests that these miRNAs constitute a
      class of developmental signalling molecules. Leaves of higher plants exhibit a
      varying degree of asymmetry along the adaxial/abaxial (upper/lower) axis. This
      asymmetry is specified through the polarized expression of class III
      homeodomain/leucine zipper (HD-ZIPIII) genes. In Arabidopsis, three such genes,
      PHABULOSA (PHB), PHAVOLUTA (PHV) and REVOLUTA (REV), are expressed throughout the
      incipient leaf, but become adaxially localized after primordium emergence.
      Downregulation of the HD-ZIPIII genes allows expression of the KANADI and YABBY
      genes, which specify abaxial fate. PHB, PHV and REV transcripts contain a
      complementary site for miRNA165 and miRNA166, which can direct their cleavage in 
      vitro. Here we show that miRNA166 constitutes a highly conserved polarizing
      signal whose expression pattern spatially defines the expression domain of the
      maize hd-zipIII family member rolled leaf1 (rld1). Moreover, the progressively
      expanding expression pattern of miRNA166 during leaf development and its
      accumulation in phloem suggests that miRNA166 may form a movable signal that
      emanates from a signalling centre below the incipient leaf.

TI  - Spatially restricted microRNA directs leaf polarity through ARGONAUTE1.
PG  - 81-4
AB  - Gene regulation by RNA interference requires the functions of the PAZ domain
      protein Argonaute. In plants, mutations in ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) are associated with 
      distinctive developmental defects that suggest a role for microRNA (miRNA) in
      organ polarity. Potential targets of miRNA regulation are the homeodomain/leucine
      zipper genes PHABULOSA (PHB) and PHAVOLUTA (PHV). These genes are expressed in a 
      polar fashion in leaf primordia and are required for adaxial cell fate. Here we
      show that a 21-nucleotide miRNA that directs cleavage of PHB/PHV messenger RNA
      accumulates first in the embryonic meristem, and then in the abaxial domain of
      the developing leaf. miRNA distribution is disrupted by mutations in AGO1,
      indicating that AGO1 affects the regulation of miRNA. In addition, interactions
      between homeodomain/leucine zipper genes and an allelic series of ago1 indicate
      that miRNA acts as a signal to specify leaf polarity.

TI  - Transcriptional regulation of mouse mu opioid receptor gene by PU.1.
PG  - 19764-74
AB  - We previously reported that the 34-bp cis-acting element of the mouse micro
      opioid receptor (MOR) gene represses transcription of the MOR gene from the
      distal promoter. Using a yeast one-hybrid screen to identify potential
      transcription factors of the MOR promoter, we have identified PU.1 as one of the 
      candidate genes. PU.1 is a member of the ets family of transcription factors,
      expressed predominantly in hematopoietic cells and microglia of brain. PU.1 plays
      an essential role in the development of both lymphoid and myeloid lineages.
      Opioids exert neuromodulatory as well as immunomodulatory effects, which are
      transduced by MOR. Moreover, MOR-deficient mice exhibit increased proliferation
      of hematopoietic cells, suggesting a possible link between the opioid system and 
      hematopoietic development. The PU.1 protein binds to the 34-bp element of the MOR
      gene in a sequence-specific manner confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift
      assay and supershift assays. We have also determined endogenous PU.1 interactions
      with the 34-bp element of MOR promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays.
      In co-transfection studies PU.1 represses MOR promoter reporter constructs
      through its PU.1 binding site. When the PU.1 gene is disrupted as in PU.1
      knock-out mice and using small interfering RNA-based strategy in RAW264.7 cells, 
      the transcription of the endogenous target MOR gene is increased significantly.
      This increase is probably mediated through modification of the chromatin
      structure, as suggested by the reversal of the PU.1-mediated repression of MOR
      promoter activity after trichostatin A treatment in neuroblastoma NMB cells. Our 
      results suggest that PU.1 may be an important regulator of the MOR gene,
      particularly in brain and immune cells.

TI  - RNA interference: a new mechanism by which FMRP acts in the normal brain? What
      can Drosophila teach us?
PG  - 68-74
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the most common heritable form of mental retardation caused
      by loss-of-function mutations in the FMR1 gene. The FMR1 gene encodes an
      RNA-binding protein that associates with translating ribosomes and acts as a
      negative translational regulator. Recent work in Drosophila melanogaster has
      shown that the fly homolog of FMR1 (dFMR1) plays an important role in regulating 
      neuronal morphology, which may underlie the observed deficits in behaviors of
      dFMR1 mutant flies. Biochemical analysis has revealed that dFMR1 forms a complex 
      that includes ribosomal proteins and, surprisingly, Argonaute2 (AGO2), an
      essential component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) that mediates RNA
      interference (RNAi) in Drosophila. dFMR1 also associates with Dicer, another
      essential processing enzyme of the RNAi pathway. Moreover, both a micro-RNA
      (miRNA) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can coimmunoprecipitate with dFMR1.
      Together these findings suggest that dFMR1 functions in an RNAi-related apparatus
      to regulate the expression of its target genes at the level of translation. These
      findings raise the possibility that Fragile X syndrome may be the result of a
      protein synthesis abnormality caused by a defect in an RNAi-related apparatus.
      Because the core mechanisms of complex behaviors such as learning and memory and 
      circadian rhythms appear to be conserved, studies of Fragile X syndrome using
      Drosophila as a model provide an economy-of-scale for identifying biological
      processes that likely underlie the abnormal morphology of dendritic spines and
      behavioral disturbances observed in Fragile X patients.

TI  - Inhibitor RNA blocks the protein translation mediated by hepatitis C virus
      internal ribosome entry site in vivo.
PG  - 664-7
AB  - AIM: To investigate the inhibitory effect of hepatitis C virus internal ribosome 
      entry site (HCV IRES) specific inhibitor RNA (IRNA) on gene expression mediated
      by HCV IRES in vivo. METHODS: By using G418 screening system, hepatoma cells
      constitutively expressing IRNA or mutant IRNA (mIRNA) were established and
      characterized, and HCV replicons containing the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR)
      were constructed by using the same method. Cotransfection of pCMVNCRluc
      containing HCV 5'UTR-luc fusion genes and eukaryotic vector of IRNA into human
      hepatic carcinoma cells (HepG2) was performed and the eukaryotic expression
      plasmid of IRNA was transfected transiently into HCV replicons. pCMVNCRluc or
      pCDNA-luc was cotransfected with pSV40-beta Gal into IRNA expressing hepatoma
      cells by using lipofectamine 2000 in vitro. Then the reporting gene expression
      level was examined at 48 h after transfection by using a luminometer and the
      expressing level of HCV C antigen was analysed with a confocal microscope.
      RESULTS: Transient expression of IRES specific IRNA could significantly inhibit
      the expression of reporter gene and viral antigen mediated by HCV IRES by 50% to 
      90% in vivo, but mIRNA lost its inhibitory activity completely. The luciferase
      gene expression mediated by HCV IRES was blocked in the HHCC constitutively
      expressing IRNA. At 48 h after transfection, the expression level of reporter
      gene decreased by 20%, but cap-dependent luciferase gene expression was not
      affected. IRNA could inhibit the HCV replicon expression 24 h after transfection 
      and the highest inhibitory activity was 80% by 72 h, and the inhibitory activity 
      was not increased until 7d after transfection. CONCLUSION: IRNA can inhibit HCV
      IRES mediated gene expression in vivo.

TI  - Gene expression profile in streptozotocin rat model for sporadic Alzheimer's
      disease.
PG  - 367-86
AB  - Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (SAD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease, is
      the most common cause of dementia. The etiology of the disease is still unknown, 
      but it is suspected to be a concert of genetic and environmental factors.
      Intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (STZ), which inhibits insulin
      receptor function, develops long-term and progressive deficits in learning,
      memory and cognitive behavior as well as biochemical changes and neuronal
      degeneration in rats similar to SAD. Micro-array analysis provides a genome-wide,
      non-biased study of gene expression patterns. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the gene expression pattern in the STZ animal model for SAD. RNA from
      rat cortex, striatum and cerebellum were analyzed for gene expression pattern via
      Affymetrix neurobiology chip-array and confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Genes such 
      as potassium channels, GABA receptors and glutamate transporter were up
      regulated, while insulin-like growth factor receptor was down regulated in STZ
      rats. These pathways may reveal molecular events causing the neuronal death in
      SAD.

TI  - [Effects of hypoxia on endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene expression in
      pulmonary artery endothelial cells and the role of protein kinase C isoforms].
PG  - 146-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the regulation of eNOS gene expression in pulmonary
      arterial endothelial cells (PAECs) by protein kinase C (PKC) and its isoforms
      during hypoxia. METHODS: Primary cultured porcine PAECs were exposed to 5%O(2)
      for 2, 6, 12, 24, 48 hours. The eNOS mRNA level was measured by RT-PCR. Western
      blot technology was used to detect the contents of eNOS protein and the 8 PKC
      isoforms. After addition of selective PKC inhibitors, bisindolylmaleimideI (BIMI,
      1 micro mol/L) or Go6983 (1 micro mol/L), PAECs were exposed to 5%O(2) for 24
      hours, then the expression of eNOS mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. Promoter activity
      of eNOS gene was determined by luciferase reporter gene assay. PAECs were
      transfected transiently with 1.6 kb fragment of the human eNOS promoter driving a
      luciferaes reporter gene, then exposed to 5%O(2). 24 h later, the activity of
      luciferase and beta-galactosidase was examined and the relative luciferase
      activity, representing the eNOS promotor activity, was calculated. After addition
      of actinomycine D (5 micro g/ml) and exposure to 5%O(2) or normoxia for 6, 12, 24
      hours, and eNOS mRNA in PAECs was measured by RT-PCR. RESULTS: After exposed to
      hypoxia for 24 hours, the expression of eNOS mRNA and protein level increased by 
      171% +/- 18% (P < 0.05) and 166% +/- 21% (P < 0.01) respectively. These
      up-regulation effects were prevented by BIM I and Go6983. Further experiments
      showed that among 8 isoforms of PKC detected in this study, only nPKCepsilon
      protein expression was changed in PAECs after exposure to hypoxia for 24 h. After
      exposure to hypoxia nPKCepsilon was translocated from cytosol to cell membrane,
      showing the activation of nPKCepsilon during hypoxia. Reporter gene assay showed 
      that hypoxia enhanced eNOS promoter activity up to 2.3 +/- 0.7 fold. In addition,
      hypoxia did not change the stability of eNOS mRNA. CONCLUSION: Hypoxia may
      up-regulate eNOS expression in PAECs by transcriptional mechanism through
      nPKCepsilon signaling pathway. Higher levels of mRNA observed during hypoxia are 
      due to increased transcription, not to increased stability of mRNA.

TI  - [VEGF antisense oligonucleotide inhibits the expression of vascular endothelial
      growth factor in human leukemic cell lines].
PG  - 22-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      antisense phosphorothioated oligodeoxynucleotide (AS-ODN) on the expression of
      VEGF in human leukemic cell lines (HL-60 and K562 cells). METHODS: The levels of 
      VEGF mRNA and protein in leukemic cells incubated with VEGF AS-ODN were measured 
      by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry assay and ELISA. MTT test was used to examine the
      influence of the culture supernatant (CS) of VEGF AS-ODN treated leukemic cells
      on the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECV304). RESULTS:
      After leukemic cells were treated with different concentrations (2.5
      approximately 15.0 micro mol/L) of VEGF AS-ODN for 24 h, VEGF mRNA level in the
      cells decreased remarkably in a concentration dependent manner, no change was
      found in the VEGF missense ODN treated cells (MS-ODN). When the leukemic cells
      were treated with 5 micro mol/L VEGF AS-ODN for 24 h, VEGF protein level
      decreased greatly both in the cells and in the CS; and the proliferation
      stimulating effect of the treated CS on the ECV304 cells reduced. Meanwhile,
      there was no obvious change in VEGF protein and its effect in the VEGF MS-ODN
      treated group. CONCLUSION: VEGF AS-ODN could inhibit VEGF expression in human
      leukemic cell lines in vitro.

TI  - Quercetin metabolites downregulate cyclooxygenase-2 transcription in human
      lymphocytes ex vivo but not in vivo.
PG  - 552-7
AB  - Flavonoids have the potential to modulate inflammation by inhibition of
      cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) transcription. In this study, we compared the effect of 
      the human flavonoid plasma metabolites (quercetin 3'-sulfate, quercetin
      3-glucuronide and 3'-methylquercetin 3-glucuronide) on expression of COX-2 mRNA
      in human lymphocytes ex vivo using TaqMan real-time RT-PCR. We show that the
      flavonoid quercetin metabolites as detected in human plasma at physiologically
      significant concentrations inhibit COX-2 expression in human lymphocytes ex vivo.
      To examine the effect in vivo, we measured COX-2 mRNA levels in 8 subjects (5 men
      and 3 women) participating in a 3-way, single-blind, randomized crossover study
      after consumption of a single meal of white, low-quercetin onions, compared with 
      yellow, high-quercetin onions. After consumption of high-quercetin onions,
      quercetin conjugates were detected in plasma (up to a maximum concentration of 4 
      micro mol/L at approximately 1 h). However, the expression of COX-2 mRNA in
      lymphocytes was unchanged by the consumption of high-quercetin onions compared
      with the low-quercetin group. The results show that a single high dose of the
      flavonoid quercetin from onions does not change COX-2 mRNA expression in human
      lymphocytes in vivo even though this change occurred in vitro and ex vivo.

TI  - RNA interfering approach for clarifying the PPARgamma pathway using lentiviral
      vector expressing short hairpin RNA.
PG  - 178-82
AB  - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) plays a central role
      in adipocyte differentiation and insulin sensitivity. Although PPARgamma also
      appears to regulate diverse cellular processes in other cell types such as
      lymphocytes, the detailed mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we
      established a lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA expression system and
      identified a potent short hairpin RNA which suppresses PPARgamma expression,
      resulting in marked inhibition of preadipocyte-to-adipocyte differentiation in
      3T3-L1 cells. Our PPARgamma-knockdown method will serve to clarify the PPARgamma 
      pathway in various cell types in vivo and in vitro, and will facilitate the
      development of therapeutic applications for a variety of diseases.

TI  - Silencing SARS-CoV Spike protein expression in cultured cells by RNA
      interference.
PG  - 141-6
AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been one of the most epidemic
      diseases threatening human health all over the world. Based on clinical studies, 
      SARS-CoV (the SARS-associated coronavirus), a novel coronavirus, is reported as
      the pathogen responsible for the disease. To date, no effective and specific
      therapeutic method can be used to treat patients suffering from SARS-CoV
      infection. RNA interference (RNAi) is a process by which the introduced small
      interfering RNA (siRNA) could cause the degradation of mRNA with identical
      sequence specificity. The RNAi methodology has been used as a tool to silence
      genes in cultured cells and in animals. Recently, this technique was employed in 
      anti-virus infections in human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C/B virus. In
      this study, RNAi technology has been applied to explore the possibility for
      prevention of SARS-CoV infection. We constructed specific siRNAs targeting the S 
      gene in SARS-CoV. We demonstrated that the siRNAs could effectively and
      specifically inhibit gene expression of Spike protein in SARS-CoV-infected cells.
      Our study provided evidence that RNAi could be a tool for inhibition of SARS-CoV.

TI  - A high-throughput method to monitor the expression of microRNA precursors.
PG  - e43
AB  - microRNAs (miRNAs) are small, functional, non-coding RNAs. miRNAs are transcribed
      as long primary transcripts (primary precursors) that are processed to the
      approximately 75 nt precursors (pre-miRNAs) by the nuclear enzyme Drosha. The
      approximately 22 nt mature miRNA is processed from the pre-miRNA by the RNase III
      Dicer. The vast majority of published studies to date have used northern blotting
      to detect the expression of miRNAs. We describe here a sensitive, high
      throughput, real-time PCR assay to monitor the expression of miRNA precursors.
      Gene-specific primers and reverse transcriptase were used to convert the primary 
      precursors and pre-miRNAs to cDNA. The expression of 23 miRNA precursors in six
      human cancer cell lines was assayed using the PCR assay. The miRNA precursors
      accumulated to different levels when compared with each other or when a single
      precursor is compared in the various cell lines. The precursor expression profile
      of three miRNAs determined by the PCR assay was identical to the mature miRNA
      expression profile determined by northern blotting. We propose that the PCR assay
      may be scaled up to include all of the 150+ known human miRNA genes and can
      easily be adaptable to other organisms such as plants, Caenorhabditis elegans and
      Drosophila.

TI  - RNase III enzymes and the initiation of gene silencing.
PG  - 214-8
AB  - Our understanding of RNA interference has been enhanced by new data concerning
      RNase III molecules. The role of Dicer has previously been established in RNAi as
      the originator of 22-mers characteristic of silencing phenomena. Recently, a
      related RNAse III enzyme, Drosha, has surfaced as another component of the RNAi
      pathway. In addition to biochemistry, protein structures have proven to be
      helpful in deciphering the enzymology of RNase III molecules.

TI  - STAT1 binds to the herpes simplex virus type 1 latency-associated transcript
      promoter.
PG  - 12-20
AB  - The authors hypothesized that environmental stimuli induce cytokines that act
      through an intracellular cascade, which includes signal transducers and
      activators of transcription (STATs), to change herpes simplex virus (HSV) gene
      expression, thereby inducing viral reactivation. The HSV type 1 (HSV-1)
      latency-associated transcript (LAT) gene regulates viral reactivation within
      neurons via an unknown mechanism. HSV-1 deletion mutants that are missing key
      portions of the LAT gene, particularly the 3' region of the LAT promoter, do not 
      reactivate normally in vivo. The authors hypothesized that STAT transcription
      factors may bind in this region to regulate viral reactivation. Electrophoretic
      mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments were performed by incubating mouse
      trigeminal ganglion (TG) nuclear extracts with each of three overlapping
      sequences representing the 3' region of the HSV-1 LAT promoter (referred to as
      oligos L1, L2, and L3). The ganglionic nuclear extracts bound specifically to
      oligos L1 and L3, but not L2. Oligos L1 and L3 contain predicted STAT binding
      sequences whereas L2 does not. Specific binding to oligo L3 (including the TATA
      box sequence) was supershifted by incubating with anti-STAT1 antibodies, but not 
      by incubating with anti-STAT3 or anti-STAT5a antibodies. Specific L3 binding was 
      reduced by competing with excess unlabeled STAT1 consensus sequences. These
      results indicate that STAT1, probably as part of a complex, is capable of binding
      to the LAT promoter on or near the TATA box. Further studies are required to
      determine if STAT1 is required for LAT expression in vivo. This work supports the
      hypothesis that interferons act through STAT1 to regulate the expression of HSV-1
      LAT.

TI  - Different expression of calpains in the anterior vaginal wall of women with and
      without uterovaginal prolapse.
PG  - 113-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Tissue ischemia-hypoxia can activate the calpain proteolytic system.
      Mechanical trauma to the upper vaginal wall and pelvic floor could compromise
      vascular perfusion and could also result in calpain expression. The aims of this 
      investigation were to assess the expression messenger RNA and proteins for
      m-calpain and micro-calpain in the vaginal walls of women with and without
      uterovaginal prolapse. METHODS: The anterior vaginal walls of 22 women with and
      without uterovaginal prolpase were evaluated using a reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction and western blotting for detecting calpain expression. 
      RESULTS: The number of messenger RNA transcripts of m- and micro-calpain was
      significantly less in women with uterovaginal prolapse than in women without
      uterovaginal prolapse (two of 11 and zero of 11 versus eight of 11 and five of
      11, P < .05). All women had m-calpain protein expression in the anterior vaginal 
      wall. However, the concentration of m-calpain protein was less, but not
      significantly different, in women with uterovaginal prolapse than in the women
      without uterovaginal prolapse (0.386 +/- 0.018 versus 0.439 +/- 0.011 optical
      density/mm2, P > .05). None of the women with uterovaginal prolapse had
      expression of micro-calpain mRNA or protein (zero of 11). Expression of protein
      of calpains in the anterior vaginal wall is not consistent with mRNA transcripts.
      CONCLUSION: Calpain expression may be compromised in the anterior vaginal wall of
      women with uterovaginal prolapse who have abnormal histologic changes in the
      vaginal connective tissues or have anterior vaginal laxity.

TI  - Crl, a low temperature-induced protein in Escherichia coli that binds directly to
      the stationary phase sigma subunit of RNA polymerase.
PG  - 19540-50
AB  - The alternative sigma factor sigma(S) (RpoS) of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase
      regulates the expression of stationary phase and stress-response genes. sigma(S) 
      is also required for the transcription of the cryptic genes csgBA that encode the
      subunits of the curli proteins. The expression of the csgBA genes is regulated in
      response to a multitude of physiological signals. In stationary phase, these
      genes are transcribed by the sigma(S) factor, and expression of the operon is
      enhanced by the small protein Crl. It has been shown that Crl stimulates the
      activity of sigma(S), leading to an increased transcription rate of a subset of
      genes of the rpoS regulon in stationary phase. However, the underlying molecular 
      mechanism has remained elusive. We show here that Crl interacts directly with
      sigma(S) and that this interaction promotes binding of the sigma(S) holoenzyme
      (Esigma(S)) to the csgBA promoter. Expression of Crl is increased during the
      transition from growing to stationary phase. Crl accumulates in stationary phase 
      cells at low temperature (30 degrees C) but not at 37 degrees C. We therefore
      propose that Crl is a second thermosensor, besides DsrA, controlling sigma(S)
      activity.

TI  - Paneth cell alpha-defensins from rhesus macaque small intestine.
PG  - 1470-8
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are secreted by small intestinal Paneth cells as
      components of innate immunity. To investigate the role of alpha-defensins in
      enteric host defenses in nonhuman primates, alpha-defensin cDNAs were isolated,
      alpha-defensin peptides were purified from rhesus macaque small bowel, and the
      bactericidal activities of the peptides were measured. Six rhesus enteric
      alpha-defensin (RED) cDNAs, RED-1 to RED-6, were identified in a jejunum cDNA
      library; the deduced RED peptides exhibited extensive diversity relative to the
      primary structures of rhesus myeloid alpha-defensins. RED-4 was purified from
      monkey jejunum, and N-terminal peptide sequencing of putative RED-4 peptides
      identified two N termini, RTCYCRTGR. and TCYCRTGRC.; these corresponded to
      alternative N termini for the RED-4 molecules, as deduced from their molecular
      masses and RED cDNAs. In situ hybridization experiments localized RED mRNAs
      exclusively to small intestinal Paneth cells. Recombinant RED-1 to RED-4 were
      purified to homogeneity and shown to be microbicidal in the low micromolar range 
      (</=10 micro g/ml) against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, with
      individual peptides exhibiting variable target cell specificities. Thus, compared
      to myeloid alpha-defensins from rhesus macaques, enteric alpha-defensin peptides 
      are highly variable in both primary structure and activity. These studies should 
      facilitate further analyses of the role of alpha-defensins in primate enteric
      immunity.

TI  - Human microRNA genes are frequently located at fragile sites and genomic regions 
      involved in cancers.
PG  - 2999-3004
AB  - A large number of tiny noncoding RNAs have been cloned and named microRNAs
      (miRs). Recently, we have reported that miR-15a and miR-16a, located at 13q14,
      are frequently deleted and/or down-regulated in patients with B cell chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia, a disorder characterized by increased survival. To further 
      investigate the possible involvement of miRs in human cancers on a genome-wide
      basis, we have mapped 186 miRs and compared their location to the location of
      previous reported nonrandom genetic alterations. Here, we show that miR genes are
      frequently located at fragile sites, as well as in minimal regions of loss of
      heterozygosity, minimal regions of amplification (minimal amplicons), or common
      breakpoint regions. Overall, 98 of 186 (52.5%) of miR genes are in
      cancer-associated genomic regions or in fragile sites. Moreover, by Northern
      blotting, we have shown that several miRs located in deleted regions have low
      levels of expression in cancer samples. These data provide a catalog of miR genes
      that may have roles in cancer and argue that the full complement of miRs in a
      genome may be extensively involved in cancers.

TI  - The nuclear dsRNA binding protein HYL1 is required for microRNA accumulation and 
      plant development, but not posttranscriptional transgene silencing.
PG  - 346-51
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 21-24 nucleotides long molecules processed from imperfect 
      double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). They regulate gene expression by targeting
      complementary mRNA for cleavage or interfering with their translation. In
      Arabidopsis, point mutations in or short truncations of the nuclear DICER-LIKE1
      (DCL1) or HEN1 protein reduce miRNA accumulation and increase uncleaved target
      mRNAs accumulation, resulting in developmental abnormalities. Here, we show that 
      miRNA accumulation also depends on the activity of HYL1, a nuclear dsRNA binding 
      protein. hyl1 mutants exhibit developmental defects overlapping with that of dcl1
      and hen1 mutants, suggesting that DCL1, HEN1, and HYL1 act together in the
      nucleus. We validate additional target mRNAs and show that reduced miRNA
      accumulation in hyl1 correlates with an increased accumulation of uncleaved
      target mRNAs, including meristem- and auxin-related genes, providing clues for
      the developmental abnormalities of hyl1 and for the previous identification of
      hyl1 as a mutant with altered responses to phytohormones. Lastly, we show that
      posttranscriptional transgene silencing occurs in hyl1, suggesting that HYL1 has 
      specialized function in the plant miRNA pathway, whereas the HYL1-related RDE-4
      and R2D2 proteins associate with DICER in the cytoplasm and act in the RNAi
      pathway in C. elegans and Drosophila, respectively.

TI  - Small amplified RNA-SAGE.
PG  - 135-52
AB  - Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) is a powerful genome-wide analytic tool
      to determine expression profiles. Since its description in 1995 by Victor
      Velculescu et al., SAGE has been widely used. Recently, the efficiency of the
      method has been emphasized as a means to identify novel transcripts or genes that
      are difficult to identify by conventional methods. SAGE is based on the principle
      that a 10-base pair (bp) cDNA fragment contains sufficient information to
      unambiguously identify a transcript, provided it is isolated from a defined
      position within this transcript. Concatenation of these sequence tags allows
      serial analysis of transcripts by sequencing multiple tags within a single clone.
      Extraction of sequence data by computer programs provides a list of sequence tags
      that reflect both qualitatively and quantitatively the gene expression profile.
      Several modifications to the initial protocol allowed to start from 1 microg
      total RNA (or 10(5) cells). In order to reduce the amount of input RNA, protocols
      including extra polymerase chain reaction (PCR) steps were designed. Linear
      amplification of the mRNA targets might have advantage over PCR by minimizing
      biases introduced by the amplification step; therefore we devised a SAGE protocol
      in which a loop of linear amplification of RNA has been included. Our approach,
      named "small amplified RNA-SAGE" (SAR-SAGE) included a T7 RNA polymerase promoter
      within an adapter derived from the standard SAGE linker. This allowed
      transcription of cDNA segments, extending from the last NlaIII site of
      transcripts to the polyA tail; these small amplified RNAs then serve as template 
      in a classical (micro)SAGE procedure. As the cDNAs are immobilized on oligo(dT)
      magnetic beads, several rounds of transcription can be performed in succession
      with the same cDNA preparation, with the potential to increase further the yield 
      in a linear way. Except for the transcription step itself, the present procedure 
      does not introduce any extra enzymatic reaction in the classical SAGE protocol,
      it is expected to keep the representation biases associated with amplification as
      low as possible.

TI  - miRNP:mRNA association in polyribosomes in a human neuronal cell line.
PG  - 387-94
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that control gene expression by
      base-pairing with their mRNA targets. miRNAs assemble into ribonucleoprotein
      complexes termed miRNPs. Animal miRNAs recognize their mRNA targets via partial
      antisense complementarity and repress mRNA translation at a step after
      translation initiation. How animal miRNAs recognize their mRNA targets and how
      they control their translation is unknown. Here we describe that in a human
      neuronal cell line, the miRNP proteins eIF2C2 (a member of the Argonaute family
      of proteins), Gemin3, and Gemin4 along with miRNAs cosediment with polyribosomes.
      Furthermore, we describe a physical association between a let-7b
      (miRNA)-containing miRNP and its putative human mRNA target in
      polyribosome-containing fractions. These findings suggest that miRNP proteins may
      play important roles in target mRNA recognition and translational repression.

TI  - Enhanced gene silencing of HIV-1 specific siRNA using microRNA designed hairpins.
PG  - 1154-8
AB  - Post-transcriptional inhibition of HIV-1 replication can be achieved by RNA
      interference (RNAi). The cellular expression of short interfering RNA (siRNA) or 
      short hairpin RNA (shRNA) homologous to regions of the HIV-1 genome decreases
      viral replication by the selective degradation of targeted RNA. Here, we
      demonstrate that another class of noncoding regulatory RNA, termed microRNA
      (miRNA), can be used to deliver antiviral RNAi. By incorporating sequences
      encoding siRNA targeting the HIV-1 transactivator protein tat into a human miR-30
      pre-microRNA (pre-miRNA) backbone, we were able to express tat siRNA in cells.
      The tat siRNA delivered as pre-miRNA precursor was 80% more effective in reducing
      HIV-1 p24 antigen production than tat siRNA expressed as conventional shRNA. Our 
      results confirm the utility of expressing HIV-1 specific siRNA through a miR-30
      precursor stem-loop structure and suggest that this strategy can be used to
      increase the antiviral potency of RNAi.

TI  - Fungal molecular diagnostics: a mini review.
PG  - 3-15
AB  - Conventional methods to identify fungi have often relied on identification of
      disease symptoms, isolation and culturing of environmental organisms, and
      laboratory identification by morphology and biochemical tests. Although these
      methods are still fundamental there is an increasing move towards molecular
      diagnostics of fungi in all fields. In this review, some of the molecular
      approaches to fungal diagnostics based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
      DNA/RNA probe technology are discussed. This includes several technological
      advances in PCR-based methods for the detection, identification and
      quantification of fungi including real-time PCR which has been successfully used 
      to provide rapid, quantitative data on fungal species from environmental samples.
      PCR and probe based methods have provided new tools for the enumeration of fungal
      species, but it is still necessary to combine the new technology with more
      conventional methods to gain a fuller understanding of interactions occurring in 
      the environment. Since its introduction in the mid 1980's PCR has provided many
      molecular diagnostic tools, some of which are discussed within this review, and
      with the advances in micro-array technology and real-time PCR methods the future 
      is bright for the development of accurate, quantitative diagnostic tools that can
      provide information not only on individual fungal species but also on whole
      communities.

TI  - Quantitative polymerase chain reaction: validation of microarray results from
      postmortem brain studies.
PG  - 337-45
AB  - Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) is now considered the "technique
      of choice" for validating gene expression changes identified with ribonucleic
      acid-based expression profiling technologies (especially micro- and macroarray
      techniques). The identification of altered gene expression profiles with
      microarrays is best viewed as the first step in the determination of potential
      disease-associated genes; however, the false-positive rate can be high,
      particularly with small sample sets and in view of the typically small
      differences observed in brain expression studies. Quantitative PCR is a rapid and
      highly sensitive technique for accurate quantification of microarray results;
      however, careful consideration of experimental design, quality of primer/probe
      design, internal standards, and normalization procedures are pivotal,
      particularly when the work involves postmortem tissue.

TI  - Short interfering RNAs specific for potato spindle tuber viroid are found in the 
      cytoplasm but not in the nucleus.
PG  - 762-9
AB  - Short interfering (si) and micro (mi) RNAs influence gene expression at
      post-transcriptional level. In plants, different classes of DICER-LIKE (DCL)
      enzymes are responsible for the generation of these small regulatory RNAs from
      different precursors. To characterize the cellular site of their generation and
      accumulation, we purified nuclei from tomato plants infected with potato spindle 
      tuber viroid (PSTVd) RNA, which is known to replicate in the nucleus via
      double-stranded (ds) RNA intermediates. We could detect PSTVd-specific siRNAs in 
      the cytoplasmic fraction, but not in the nuclear fraction. To correlate the
      localization of the PSTVd-specific siRNAs with that of similarly sized small
      RNAs, we studied the compartmentalization of a naturally occurring miRNA. We
      could detect the precursor of miR167 in the nucleus, but the mature miRNA was
      found only in the cytoplasmic fraction. We discuss the consequences of this
      finding for the model of viroid replication and heterochromatin formation.

TI  - Biochemical dissection of RNA silencing in plants.
PG  - 223-44
AB  - Although RNA silencing was first discovered in plants, thus far it has been
      studied biochemically only in animals, where it is known as RNA interference
      (RNAi). In animals, two components of the RNAi pathway have been identified:
      Dicer, a multidomain RNase III that converts long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)
      into small interfering RNA (siRNA) and the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), 
      as siRNA-containing protein-RNA complex that targets complementary mRNA for
      destruction. We have developed methods for the biochemical dissection of plant
      RNA silencing. In this chapter, we describe in detail how to use wheat germ
      extract to study two distinct Dicer-like activities, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
      (RdRP), and endogenous microRNA-programmed RISC activities. These comprehensive
      protocols should prove useful in the further dissection of the plant RNA
      silencing pathway, as well as for the validation of the predicted targets of
      endogenous plant microRNAs.

TI  - Short interfering RNAs can induce unexpected and divergent changes in the levels 
      of untargeted proteins in mammalian cells.
PG  - 1892-7
AB  - RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) is a widely
      used method to analyze gene function. To use RNAi knockdown accurately to infer
      gene function, it is essential to determine the specificity of siRNA-mediated
      RNAi. We have assessed the specificity of 10 different siRNAs corresponding to
      the MEN1 gene by examining the expression of two additional genes, TP53 (p53) and
      CDKN1A (p21), which are considered functionally unrelated to menin but are
      sensitive markers of cell state. MEN1 RNA and corresponding protein levels were
      all reduced after siRNA transfection of HeLa cells, although the degree of
      inhibition mediated by individual siRNAs varied. Unexpectedly, we observed
      dramatic and significant changes in protein levels of p53 and p21 that were
      unrelated to silencing of the target gene. The modulations in p53 and p21 levels 
      were not abolished on titration of the siRNAs, and similar results were obtained 
      in three other cell lines; in none of the cell lines tested did we see an effect 
      on the protein levels of actin. These data suggest that siRNAs can induce
      nonspecific effects on protein levels that are siRNA sequence dependent but that 
      these effects may be difficult to detect until genes central to a pivotal
      cellular response, such as p53 and p21, are studied. We find no evidence that
      activation of the double-stranded RNA-triggered IFN-associated antiviral pathways
      accounts for these effects, but we speculate that partial complementary sequence 
      matches to off-target genes may result in a micro-RNA-like inhibition of
      translation.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of a novel single-stranded RNA virus infecting the
      bloom-forming diatom Rhizosolenia setigera.
PG  - 704-11
AB  - A novel single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus specifically infecting the
      bloom-forming diatom Rhizosolenia setigera (R. setigera RNA virus [RsRNAV]) was
      isolated from Ariake Sea, Japan. Viral replication occurred within the cytoplasm,
      and the virus particle was icosahedral, lacked a tail, and was 32 nm in diameter 
      on average. The major nucleic acid extracted from the RsRNAV particles was an
      ssRNA molecule 11.2 kb in length, although smaller RNA molecules (0.6, 1.2, and
      1.5 kb) were occasionally observed. The major structural proteins of RsRNAV were 
      41.5, 41.0, and 29.5 kDa. Inter- and intraspecies host specificity tests revealed
      that RsRNAV is not only species specific but also strain specific and that its
      intraspecies host specificity is diverse among virus clones. The latent period of
      RsRNAV was 2 days, and the burst sizes were 3,100 and 1,010 viruses per host cell
      when viruses were inoculated into the host culture at the exponential and
      stationary growth phases, respectively, at 15 degrees C under a 12-h-12-h
      light-dark cycle of ca. 110 micro mol of photons m(-2) s(-1) with cool white
      fluorescent illumination. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing
      the biological properties of a virus infecting a diatom. Further studies on
      RsRNAV will be helpful in understanding the ecological relationship between
      diatoms and viruses in nature.

TI  - Mouse spermine oxidase gene splice variants. Nuclear subcellular localization of 
      a novel active isoform.
PG  - 760-70
AB  - Spermine oxidase (SMO) is a flavoenzyme involved in polyamine homeostasis in
      animal cells. The mouse spermine oxidase gene (mSMO) codes for splice variants,
      including the previously reported major active isoform, herein named alfa
      (alpha). In the present work, eight additional gene splicing variants were
      characterized. The heterologous expression and biochemical characterization of
      three recombinant isoforms (namely mSMOmu, -gamma and -delta) revealed that only 
      the recombinant protein mSMO micro displays biochemical characteristics similar
      to those of mSMOalpha; the other two recombinant proteins contained no detectable
      SMO activity. In order to investigate in greater detail, the SMO enzyme activity 
      associated with their subcellular localization, mSMOalpha and -mu V5-tagged
      proteins were transiently and stably transfected in the murine neuroblastoma cell
      line, N18TG2. Very interestingly, the novel active mSMOmu isoform was found to be
      present in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, thus providing the first
      evidence of SMO activity in the nucleus, while a cytoplasmic localization was
      confirmed for the mSMOalpha isoform. In addition, the relative transcription
      levels of the gene splicing variants were evaluated by RT-PCR analysis to verify 
      a relationship with the SMO enzyme activity in various murine organs.

TI  - Glucocorticoids modulate neurotransmitter-induced glycogen metabolism in cultured
      cortical astrocytes.
PG  - 900-8
AB  - Glucocorticoids (GC) are considered as key modulators of glycogen homeostasis in 
      peripheral tissues, but their role in the central nervous system has only
      partially been characterized. Exposure of primary cultures of cortical astrocytes
      to dexamethasone (DEX), a synthetic glucocorticoid, results in the reduction of
      noradrenaline (NA)-induced glycogen synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner
      with a IC50 of 4.88 nm and a maximum inhibition of 51%. Such an effect is
      mediated via glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), since it is mimicked by the
      glucocorticoid analogue RU28362 (100 nm) and prevented by the GR antagonist
      RU38486 (1 micro m). DEX does not act through alteration of signal transduction
      mechanisms, as cAMP formation induced by noradrenergic stimulation was unchanged.
      Moreover, glycogen synthesis was inhibited to the same extent when DEX was
      applied either together or only after a brief NA application. Neither
      [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake nor lactate release was altered by DEX in the presence 
      of NA, demonstrating that inhibition of glycogen synthesis is not a consequence
      of reduced glucose utilization or availability. Interestingly, enhancement of
      glycogen synthase activity induced by NA was reduced in the presence of DEX
      (-27%). These results suggest that GC could have a significant influence on
      neuroenergetics as they could modulate activity-related changes in brain glycogen
      metabolism.

TI  - Interleukin-12 enhances the sensitivity of human osteosarcoma cells to
      4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide by a mechanism involving the Fas/Fas-ligand
      pathway.
PG  - 777-83
AB  - Cyclophosphamide (CY) and its derivative ifosfamide are alkylating agents used to
      treat osteosarcoma (OS). The purpose of these studies was to determine whether
      alkylating agents affect the expression of Fas ligand (FasL) and whether
      interleukin 12 enhances the sensitivity of human OS cells to alkylating agents.
      4-Hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC), the preactivated CY compound, and
      4-hydroperoxydidechlorocloclophosphamide (4-HDC), its nonalkylating analogue,
      human OS LM6 cells, and a clone of cells derived by transfection with the
      interleukin 12 gene (LM6-#6) were used for these studies. Incubation of LM6 and
      LM6-#6 with 10 micro M 4-HC increased the expression of FasL mRNA (2.5- and
      3.0-fold, respectively). By contrast, 4-HDC, Adriamycin (ADR), cisplatin (CDP),
      and methotrexate (MTX) had no effect on FasL mRNA expression. Increased FasL
      expression after treatment with 4-HC was also demonstrated by
      immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Drug-induced FasL was functional and
      mediated cell death. We examined the effect of FasL up-regulation by 4-HC on LM6 
      and LM6-#6 cells. Flow cytometry showed that LM6-#6 cells expressed 2.2-fold more
      Fas than LM6 cells. Cytotoxicity of 4-HC, 4-HDC, ADR, CDP, and MTX on LM6,
      LM6-neo, and LM6-#6 were quantified. Colony-forming assay revealed an IC(50) of
      2.10 micro M for 4-HC in LM6-neo cells compared with 0.41 micro M in LM6-#6
      cells. The IC(50) for 4-HDC, ADR, CDP, and MTX were not significantly different
      between the two cell lines. We concluded that the increased expression of Fas
      enhanced LM6-#6 sensitivity to 4-HC. These data indicate that Fas/FasL may be
      involved in the cytotoxic pathway of CY. Combining biological agents with
      chemotherapeutic agents that have complementary Fas/FasL pathway actions may
      offer new therapeutic alternatives.

TI  - Imatinib inhibits proliferation of Ewing tumor cells mediated by the stem cell
      factor/KIT receptor pathway, and sensitizes cells to vincristine and
      doxorubicin-induced apoptosis.
PG  - 751-61
AB  - PURPOSE AND EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The stem cell factor/KIT receptor loop may
      represent a novel target for molecular-based therapies of Ewing tumor. We
      analyzed the in vitro impact of KIT blockade by imatinib in Ewing tumor cell
      lines. RESULTS: KIT expression was detected in 4 of 4 Ewing tumor cell lines and 
      in 49 of 110 patient samples (44.5%) by immunohistochemistry and/or Western blot 
      analysis. KIT expression was stronger in Ewing tumors showing EWS-FLI1 nontype 1 
      fusions. Despite absence of c-kit mutations, constitutive and ligand-inducible
      phosphorylation of KIT was found in all tumor cell lines, indicating an active
      receptor. Treatment with KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (0.5-20 micro M) 
      induced down-regulation of KIT phosphorylation and dose response inhibition of
      cell proliferation (IC(50), 12-15 micro M). However, imatinib administered alone 
      at doses close to IC(50) for growth inhibition (10 micro M) did not induce a
      significant increase in apoptosis. We then analyzed if blockade of KIT loop
      through imatinib (10 micro M) was able to increase the antitumor in vitro effect 
      of doxorubicin (DXR) and vincristine (VCR), drugs usually used in Ewing tumor
      treatment. Addition of imatinib decreased in 15-20 and 15-36% of the
      proliferative rate of Ewing tumor cells exposed to DXR and VCR, respectively, and
      increased in 15 and 30% of the apoptotic rate of Ewing tumor cells exposed to the
      same drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of Ewing tumor cell proliferation by imatinib
      is mediated through blockade of KIT receptor signaling. Inhibition of KIT
      increases sensitivity of these cells to DXR and VCR. This study supports a
      potential role for imatinib in the treatment of Ewing tumor.

TI  - Radiosensitization by pan ErbB inhibitor CI-1033 in vitro and in vivo.
PG  - 691-700
AB  - PURPOSE: Overexpression of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases has been 
      associated with uncontrolled growth of many tumor types and, therefore, presents 
      a promising molecular target for cancer therapy. CI-1033 is a small molecule
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor that differs from other 4-anilinoquinazolines by being 
      a pan ErbB (instead of epidermal growth factor receptor-specific) irreversible
      (instead of reversible) inhibitor. Therefore, we investigated the antitumor
      effect of CI-1033 alone and in combination with ionizing radiation in vitro and
      in vivo. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We selected three human colon carcinoma cell-lines 
      (LoVo, Caco-2, which express activated epidermal growth factor receptor and
      ErbB-2 family members, and SW620, which does not), and analyzed the effects of
      CI-1033 both in vitro and in vivo. For in vivo studies LoVo and Caco-2 cells were
      implanted s.c. in the flank of nude mice. After the tumor reached approximately
      100 mm(3), treatment was initiated with 20 mg/kg of CI-1033 (orally once daily x 
      5 for 3 successive weeks), radiation treatment (a total of 30 Gy given in 2 Gy
      once daily x 5 for 3 successive weeks), or a combination of both CI-1033 and
      radiation treatment. RESULTS: We found that exposure of LoVo and Caco-2, but not 
      SW620 cells, to CI-1033 in the range of 1-3 micro M could inhibit constitutive
      signaling by tyrosine kinases, arrest cell growth, inhibit cells in G(1),
      stimulate expression of p53, and induce apoptosis. The inhibition of cell growth 
      by CI-1033 seemed to produce only minimal radiosensitization in LoVo and Caco-2
      cells. In contrast, the combination of CI-1033 and radiation produced significant
      (P < 0.0005 and P = 0.0002, respectively) and prolonged suppression of tumor
      growth in both the tumor types when compared with either treatment alone.
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that CI-1033 can increase the effectiveness
      of radiation therapy. The extent of suppression of tyrosine kinase activity by
      CI-1033, rather than the amount of activity in untreated cells, seemed to be more
      closely associated with the efficacy of combination treatment.

TI  - Functional silencing of hepatic microsomal glucose-6-phosphatase gene expression 
      in vivo by adenovirus-mediated delivery of short hairpin RNA.
PG  - 69-73
AB  - An expression cassette containing mouse U6 polymerase III promoter directing
      expression of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting murine microsomal
      glucose-6-phosphatase (G6P) transcript was generated. This construct was packaged
      into an adenoviral (AdV) backbone and viral stocks generated. Mice injected
      intravenously with AdV-G6PshRNA exhibited a significant reduction in postprandial
      glucose levels and had significantly elevated steady-state hepatic glycogen
      stores. Target gene silencing was confirmed by measurements demonstrating a
      significant reduction in both hepatic G6P transcript level and phosphohydrolase
      activity. These findings provide evidence that AdV delivery of expressed shRNA
      can be a productive tool to explore gene function in vivo.

TI  - Expression of opioid receptors during peripheral inflammation.
PG  - 51-61
AB  - Opioid receptors (OR) and their mRNA are present in the central and peripheral
      nervous system of mammals. In this review we examine the behavioral effects of
      opioids and the expression of their receptors during peripheral inflammation in
      two experimental models: the rat paw and the mouse intestine. Inflammation
      increased the antinociceptive (paw) and the inhibitory effects of opioids in the 
      gut (transit, permeability and plasma extravasation) by interaction with OR
      located at peripheral sites. Based on agonist efficacy, micro > delta >> kappa-OR
      mediate the antinociceptive and antitransit effects of opioids during
      inflammation. Intestinal permeability is modulated by delta = micro >> kappa-OR, 
      while kappa > delta >> micro-OR are involved in the inhibition of plasma
      extravasation. Intestinal inflammation increased the transcription of micro and
      delta-OR (but not kappa) genes in the gut, thus explaining the enhanced
      antitransit and antisecretory effects of micro and delta-OR agonists; however,
      the increased inhibitory effects of kappa-OR agonists on plasma extravasation
      could result from post-transcriptional regulation of the receptor. Similarly, the
      increased expression of peripheral micro-OR observed in the rat paw during
      inflammation, occurs at post-transcriptional levels and is related to an
      increased axonal transport from the dorsal root ganglia to peripheral terminals. 
      The sites and mechanisms implicated in the increased transcription of micro and
      delta-OR during intestinal inflammation are under investigation.

      or translational repression. Although they escaped notice until relatively
      recently, miRNAs comprise one of the more abundant classes of gene regulatory
      molecules in multicellular organisms and likely influence the output of many
      protein-coding genes.

TI  - Paenibacillus favisporus sp. nov., a xylanolytic bacterium isolated from cow
      faeces.
PG  - 59-64
AB  - During a search for xylan-degrading micro-organisms, a sporulated bacterium was
      recovered from recent and old cow dung and rectal samples. The isolates were
      identified as members of a novel species of the genus Paenibacillus, based on 16S
      rRNA gene sequences. According to the results of phylogenetic analysis, the most 
      closely related species was Paenibacillus azoreducens. Phenotypic and
      chemotaxonomic analyses and DNA-DNA hybridization experiments also showed that
      the isolates belonged to a novel species of the genus Paenibacillus. The novel
      species is a facultatively anaerobic, motile, Gram-variable, sporulated rod. The 
      spores of this rod-shaped micro-organism occur in slightly swollen sporangia and 
      are honeycomb-shaped. The main fatty acid is anteiso-branched C(15:0). Growth was
      observed with many carbohydrates, including xylan, as the only carbon source and 
      gas production was not observed from glucose. The novel species produces a wide
      variety of hydrolytic enzymes, such as xylanases, cellulases, amylases,
      gelatinase, urease and beta-galactosidase. On the contrary, it does not produce
      caseinase, phenylalanine deaminase or lysine decarboxylase. According to the data
      obtained in this work, the strains belong to a novel species, for which the name 
      Paenibacillus favisporus sp. nov. is proposed (type strain, GMP01T=LMG
      20987T=CECT 5760T).

TI  - Differential gene expression in auristatin PHE-treated Cryptococcus neoformans.
PG  - 561-7
AB  - The antifungal pentapeptide auristatin PHE was recently shown to interfere with
      microtubule dynamics and nuclear and cellular division in the opportunistic
      pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. To gain a broader understanding of the cellular
      response of C. neoformans to auristatin PHE, mRNA differential display (DD) and
      reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) were applied. Examination of approximately 60%
      of the cell transcriptome from cells treated with 1.5 times the MIC (7.89 micro
      M) of auristatin PHE for 90 min revealed 29 transcript expression differences
      between control and drug-treated populations. Differential expression of seven of
      the transcripts was confirmed by RT-PCR, as was drug-dependent modulation of an
      additional seven transcripts by RT-PCR only. Among genes found to be
      differentially expressed were those encoding proteins involved in transport, cell
      cycle regulation, signal transduction, cell stress, DNA repair, nucleotide
      metabolism, and capsule production. For example, RHO1 and an open reading frame
      (ORF) encoding a protein with 91% similarity to the Schizophyllum commune 14-3-3 
      protein, both involved in cell cycle regulation, were down-regulated, as was the 
      gene encoding the multidrug efflux pump Afr1p. An ORF encoding a protein with 57%
      identity to the heat shock protein HSP104 in Pleurotus sajor-caju was
      up-regulated. Also, three transcripts of unknown function were responsive to
      auristatin PHE, which may eventually contribute to the elucidation of the
      function of their gene products. Further study of these differentially expressed 
      genes and expression of their corresponding proteins are warranted to evaluate
      how they may be involved in the mechanism of action of auristatin PHE. This
      information may also contribute to an explanation of the selectivity of
      auristatin PHE for C. neoformans. This is the first report of drug action using
      DD in C. neoformans.

TI  - New class of bacterial phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitors with high potency 
      and broad-spectrum activity.
PG  - 525-32
AB  - Phenylalanyl (Phe)-tRNA synthetase (Phe-RS) is an essential enzyme which
      catalyzes the transfer of phenylalanine to the Phe-specific transfer RNA
      (tRNA(Phe)), a key step in protein biosynthesis.
      Phenyl-thiazolylurea-sulfonamides were identified as a novel class of potent
      inhibitors of bacterial Phe-RS by high-throughput screening and chemical
      variation of the screening hit. The compounds inhibit Phe-RS of Escherichia coli,
      Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus, with
      50% inhibitory concentrations in the nanomolar range. Enzyme kinetic measurements
      demonstrated that the compounds bind competitively with respect to the natural
      substrate Phe. All derivatives are highly selective for the bacterial Phe-RS
      versus the corresponding mammalian cytoplasmic and human mitochondrial enzymes.
      Phenyl-thiazolylurea-sulfonamides displayed good in vitro activity against
      Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Haemophilus, and Moraxella strains, reaching MICs 
      below 1 micro g/ml. The antibacterial activity was partly antagonized by
      increasing concentrations of Phe in the culture broth in accordance with the
      competitive binding mode. Further evidence that inhibition of tRNA(Phe) charging 
      is the antibacterial principle of this compound class was obtained by proteome
      analysis of Bacillus subtilis. Here, the phenyl-thiazolylurea-sulfonamides
      induced a protein pattern indicative of the stringent response. In addition, an
      E. coli strain carrying a relA mutation and defective in stringent response was
      more susceptible than its isogenic relA(+) parent strain. In vivo efficacy was
      investigated in a murine S. aureus sepsis model and a S. pneumoniae sepsis model 
      in rats. Treatment with the phenyl-thiazolylurea-sulfonamides reduced the
      bacterial titer in various organs by up to 3 log units, supporting the potential 
      value of Phe-RS as a target in antibacterial therapy.

TI  - In vitro selection and characterization of resistance to macrolides and related
      antibiotics in Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
PG  - 460-5
AB  - Macrolide-resistant mutants of Mycoplasma pneumoniae were selected in vitro from 
      the susceptible reference strain M129, by 23 to 50 serial passages in
      subinhibitory concentrations of macrolides and related antibiotics, erythromycin 
      A, azithromycin, josamycin, clindamycin, quinupristin, quinupristin-dalfopristin,
      pristinamycin, and telithromycin. Mutants for which the MICs are increased could 
      be selected with all antibiotics except the streptogramin B quinupristin.
      Portions of genes encoding 23S rRNA (domains II and V) and ribosomal proteins L4 
      and L22 of mutants were amplified by PCR, and their nucleotide sequences were
      compared to those of the susceptible strain M129. No mutation could be detected
      in domain II of 23S rRNA. Two point mutations in domain V of 23S rRNA, C2611A and
      A2062G, were selected in the presence of erythromycin A, azithromycin, josamycin,
      quinupristin-dalfopristin, and telithromycin. Mutants selected in the presence of
      clindamycin and telithromycin harbored a single amino acid change (H70R or H70L, 
      respectively) in ribosomal protein L4, whereas insertions of one, two, or three
      adjacent glycines at position 60 (M. pneumoniae numbering) were selected in the
      presence of both streptogramin combinations. Telithromycin was the sole
      antibiotic that selected for substitutions (P112R and A114T) and deletions
      ((111)IPRA(114)) in ribosomal protein L22. Three sequential mutational events in 
      23S rRNA and in both ribosomal proteins were required to categorize the strain as
      resistant to the ketolide. Azithromycin and erythromycin A were the only selector
      antibiotics that remained active (MICs, 0.06 and 1 micro g/ml, respectively) on
      their mutants selected after 50 passages.

TI  - Nuclear bodies and compartmentalization of pre-mRNA splicing factors in higher
      plants.
PG  - 255-66
AB  - We studied the fine structural organization of nuclear bodies in the root
      meristem during germination of maize and Arabidopsis thaliana using electron
      microscopy (EM). Cajal bodies (CBs) were observed in quiescent embryos and
      germinating cells in both species. The number and distribution of CBs were
      investigated. To characterize the nuclear splicing domains, immunofluorescence
      labelling with antibodies against splicing factors (U2B" and m3G-snRNAs) and in
      situ hybridisation (with U1/U6 antisense probes) were performed combined with
      confocal microscopy. Antibodies specific to the Arabidopsis SR splicing factor
      atRSp31 were produced. AtRSp31 was detected in quiescent nuclei and in
      germinating cells. This study revealed an unexpected speckled nuclear
      organization of atRSp31 in root epidermal cells where micro-clusters of
      interchromatin granules were also observed by EM. Therefore, we examined the
      distribution of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged atRSp31 in living cells
      after Agrobacterium -mediated transient expression. When expressed transiently,
      atRSp31-GFP exhibited a speckled distribution in leaf cells. Treatments with
      alpha-amanitin, okadaic acid, staurosporine or heat shock induced the speckles to
      reorganize. Furthermore, we generated stable Arabidopsis transgenics expressing
      atRSp31-GFP. The distribution of the fusion protein was identical to that of
      endogenous atRSp31. Three-dimensional time-lapse confocal microscopy showed that 
      speckles were highly dynamic domains over time.

TI  - High temperature stress of Brassica napus during flowering reduces micro- and
      megagametophyte fertility, induces fruit abortion, and disrupts seed production.
PG  - 485-95
AB  - High temperature stress (HTS), during flowering, decreases seed production in
      many plants. To determine the effect of a moderate HTS on flowering, fruit and
      seed set in Brassica napus, plants were exposed to a HTS (8/16 h dark/light, 18
      degrees C night, ramped at 2 degrees C h-1, over 6 h, to 35 degrees C for 4 h,
      ramped at 2 degrees C h-1 back to 23 degrees C for 6 h) for 1 or 2 weeks after
      the initiation of flowering. Although flowering on the HTS-treated plants, during
      both the 1 week and 2 week HTS treatments, was equal to that of control-grown
      plants, fruit and seed development, as well as seed weight, were significantly
      reduced. Under HTS, flowers either developed into seedless, parthenocarpic fruit 
      or aborted on the stem. At the cessation of the HTS, plants compensated for the
      lack of fruit and seed production by increasing the number of lateral
      inflorescences produced. During the HTS, pollen viability and germinability were 
      slightly reduced. In vitro pollen tube growth at 35 degrees C, from both control 
      pollen and pollen developed under a HTS, appeared abnormal, however, in vivo tube
      growth to the micropyle appeared normal. Reciprocal pollination of HTS or control
      pistils with HTS or control pollen indicated that the combined effects of HTS on 
      both micro- and megagametophytes was required to knock out fruit and seed
      development. Expression profiles for a subset of HEAT SHOCK PROTEINs (HSP101,
      HSP70, HSP17.6) showed that both micro- and megagametophytes were thermosensitive
      despite HTS-induced expression from these genes.

TI  - Selective killing of vaccinia virus by LL-37: implications for eczema vaccinatum.
PG  - 1763-7
AB  - Possible bioterrorism with smallpox has led to the resumption of smallpox
      (vaccinia virus) immunization. One complication, eczema vaccinatum, occurs
      primarily in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). Skin lesions of patients with 
      AD, but not psoriasis, is deficient in the cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide
      (LL-37) and human beta-defensin-2 (HBD-2). We hypothesized that this defect may
      explain the susceptibility of patients with AD to eczema vaccinatum. The Wyeth
      vaccine strain of vaccinia virus was incubated with varying concentrations of
      human (LL-37) and murine (CRAMP) cathelicidins, human alpha-defensin (HBD-1,
      HBD-2), and a control peptide. Outcomes included quantification of viral PFU,
      vaccinia viral gene expression by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, and changes in
      virion structure by transmission electron microscopy. CRAMP knockout mice and
      control animals were inoculated by skin pricks with 2 x 10(5) PFU of vaccinia and
      examined daily for pox development. Physiologic amounts of human and murine
      cathelicidins (10-50 micro M), but not human defensins, which had antibacterial
      activity, resulted in the in vitro reduction of vaccinia viral plaque formation
      (p < 0.0001), vaccinia mRNA expression (p < 0.001), and alteration of vaccinia
      virion structure. In vivo vaccinia pox formation occurred in four of six CRAMP
      knockout animals and in only one of 15 control mice (p < 0.01). These data
      support a role for cathelicidins in the inhibition of orthopox virus (vaccinia)
      replication both in vitro and in vivo. Susceptibility of patients with AD to
      eczema vaccinatum may be due to a deficiency of cathelicidin.

TI  - Prediction of locally stable RNA secondary structures for genome-wide surveys.
PG  - 186-90
AB  - MOTIVATION: Recently novel classes of functional RNAs, most prominently the
      miRNAs have been discovered, strongly suggesting that further types of functional
      RNAs are still hidden in the recently completed genomic DNA sequences. Only few
      techniques are known, however, to survey genomes for such RNA genes. When
      sufficiently similar sequences are not available for comparative approaches the
      only known remedy is to search directly for structural features. RESULTS: We
      present here efficient algorithms for computing locally stable RNA structures at 
      genome-wide scales. Both the minimum energy structure and the complete matrix of 
      base pairing probabilities can be computed in theta(N x L2) time and theta(N +
      L2) memory in terms of the length N of the genome and the size L of the largest
      secondary structure motifs of interest. In practice, the 100 Mb of the complete
      genome of Caenorhabditis elegans can be folded within about half a day on a
      modern PC with a search depth of L = 100. This is sufficient example for a survey
      for miRNAs. AVAILABILITY: The software described in this contribution will be
      available for download at http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/ as part of the
      Vienna RNA Package.

TI  - Sequence-specific detection of MicroRNAs by signal-amplifying ribozymes.
PG  - 722-3
AB  - The rational and straightforward design of hairpin ribozymes that can be
      sequence-specifically induced by external oligonucleotides is described. Due to
      intrinsic signal amplification, their sensitivity is at least an order of
      magnitude increased compared to standard molecular beacons. We applied this
      system to the detection of microRNAs, a recently discovered class of small
      endogenous RNA molecules that are involved in gene regulation. We show that the
      cognate microRNA can reliably and sensitively be detected at low concentrations
      in a mix of other microRNA sequences. These probes may be useful in applications 
      that require direct detection of minute amounts of small DNAs or RNAs.

TI  - Exportin 5 is a RanGTP-dependent dsRNA-binding protein that mediates nuclear
      export of pre-miRNAs.
PG  - 185-91
AB  - microRNAs (miRNAs) are widespread among eukaryotes, and studies in several
      systems have revealed that miRNAs can regulate expression of specific genes.
      Primary miRNA transcripts are initially processed to approximately 70-nucleotide 
      (nt) stem-loop structures (pre-miRNAs), exported to the cytoplasm, further
      processed to yield approximately 22-nt dsRNAs, and finally incorporated into
      ribonucleoprotein particles, which are thought to be the active species. Here we 
      study nuclear export of pre-miRNAs and show that the process is saturable and
      thus carrier-mediated. Export is sensitive to depletion of nuclear RanGTP and,
      according to this criterion, mediated by a RanGTP-dependent exportin. An unbiased
      affinity chromatography approach with immobilized pre-miRNAs identified exportin 
      5 as the pre-miRNA-specific export carrier. We have cloned exportin 5 from
      Xenopus and demonstrate that antibodies raised against the Xenopus receptor
      specifically block pre-miRNA export from nuclei of Xenopus oocytes. We further
      show that exportin 5 interacts with double-stranded RNA in a sequence-independent
      manner.

TI  - Complementary miRNA pairs suggest a regulatory role for miRNA:miRNA duplexes.
PG  - 171-5
AB  - microRNAs (miRNAs) are 21-22-nucleotide noncoding RNAs that are widely believed
      to regulate complementary mRNA targets. However, due to the modest amount of
      pairing involved, only a few out of the hundreds of known animal miRNAs have thus
      far been connected to mRNA targets. Here, we considered the possibility that
      miRNAs might regulate non-mRNA targets, namely other miRNAs. To do so, we
      conducted a systematic assessment of the nearly complete catalogs of animal
      miRNAs for potential miRNA:miRNA complements. Our analysis uncovered several
      compelling examples that strongly suggest a function for miRNA duplexes, thus
      adding a potential layer of regulatory sophistication to the small RNA world.
      Interestingly, the most striking examples involve miRNAs complementary to members
      of the K-box family and Brd-box family, two classes of miRNAs previously
      implicated in regulation of Notch target genes. We emphasize that patterns of
      nucleotide constraint indicate that miRNA complementarity is not a simple
      consequence of miRNA:miRNA* complementarity; however, our findings do suggest
      that the potential regulatory consequences of the latter also deserve
      investigation.

TI  - Expression of the insulin-like growth factor I receptor and urokinase plasminogen
      activator in breast cancer is associated with poor survival: potential for
      intervention with 17-allylamino geldanamycin.
PG  - 286-91
AB  - Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) expression in breast cancer is associated
      with relapse and a reduction in disease-specific survival. Thus, efforts are
      under way to identify uPA inhibitors. By screening a chemical library of >1000
      compounds, 17-allyaminogeldanamycin (17AAG) was identified as a potent inhibitor 
      of uPA by the National Cancer Institute and is now in Phase I clinical trials. At
      this time, it remains unclear how 17AAG blocks uPA; one possibility is through
      disruption of the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) pathway. This
      would be consistent with studies from our laboratory showing that activation of
      IGF-IR results in the induction of uPA protein. In the study described herein, we
      observed that IGF-IR and uPA were highly expressed in 87 and 55% of breast cancer
      by screening tumor tissue microarrays representing 930 cases. A significant
      proportion (52.1% = 354 of 680 cases, P < 0.0001) of the patients had tumors
      expressing both proteins. uPA alone (P = 0.033) or in combination with IGF-IR (P 
      = 0.0104) was indicative of decreased disease-specific survival. Next, we
      demonstrated that treating MDA-MB-231 cells with increasing concentrations of
      17AAG resulted in IGF-IR degradation (IC(50) = 1.0 micro M) and blocked signal
      transduction through the Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.
      Finally, we found that 17AAG had a robust inhibitory effect on the production of 
      uPA mRNAand protein in the presence of IGF-I. Thus, our study raises the
      possibility that 17AAG could prove to be an effective therapeutic agent for a
      large number of breast cancer patients by inhibiting the IGF-IR and ultimately
      uPA.

TI  - Heparin/heparan sulfate interacting protein plays a role in apoptosis induced by 
      anticancer drugs.
PG  - 873-9
AB  - Heparin/heparan sulfate interacting protein (HIP, also known as ribosome protein 
      L29) is involved in cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions and
      influences cell proliferation, migration and differentiation. In the present
      study, we investigated the role of HIP in anticancer drug-induced apoptosis. Both
      colon cancer HCT-116 and HT-29 cells showed dose-dependent down-regulation of HIP
      expression when treated with sodium butyrate. The down-regulation was negatively 
      correlated with the percentage of apoptotic cells (R = -0.955, P = 0.03 and R =
      -0.792, P = 0.06 for HCT-116 and HT-29 cells, respectively). The correlation
      between HIP expression and apoptosis in HCT-116 cells was also evident in the
      differential expression of HIP in the floating and adherent cell populations.
      Most apoptotic cells were distributed in the floating population. HIP expression 
      in this population was approximately 30% lower than adherent and untreated
      control cells. HIP expression in HCT-116 cells was also significantly decreased
      in parallel with apoptosis after treatment with 50 micro M camptothecin and 20
      micro M 5-fluorouracil. This indicates that the down-regulation of HIP may be a
      general phenomenon in anticancer drug-induced apoptosis. The down-regulation of
      HIP occurred in the early phase of apoptosis, in parallel with the activation of 
      caspase-3 and the externalization of phosphatidylserine. The functional
      significance of HIP in apoptosis was shown by knocking down the expression of HIP
      using small interfering RNA. A 50% reduction in HIP expression was sufficient to 
      increase the percentage of apoptotic cells (from 11 to 20%) and increase the
      sensitivity of the cells to apoptosis induced by 1 mM butyrate by 60%. These
      results indicate that HIP may play an important role in anticancer drug-induced
      apoptosis.

TI  - The C. elegans microRNA let-7 binds to imperfect let-7 complementary sites from
      the lin-41 3'UTR.
PG  - 132-7
AB  - Caenorhabditis elegans let-7, a founding member of the microRNA family, is
      predicted to bind to six sites in the 3'UTR of the mRNA of its target gene,
      lin-41, to down-regulate LIN-41. Here, we demonstrate that wild-type let-7
      microRNA binds in vitro to RNA from the lin-41 3'UTR. This interaction is
      dependent on two conserved let-7 complementary sites (LCSs). A 27-nucleotide
      sequence between the LCSs is also necessary for down-regulation in vivo. LCS
      mutations compensatory to the lesion in let-7(n2853) can partially restore lin-41
      3'UTR function in a let-7(n2853) background, providing the first experimental
      evidence for an animal miRNA binding directly to its validated target in vivo.

TI  - Microbiological characterization and probiotic potential of koko and koko sour
      water, African spontaneously fermented millet porridge and drink.
PG  - 384-97
AB  - AIMS: To identify and examine the diversity of predominant lactic acid bacteria
      (LAB) in koko and koko sour water (KSW) from different Ghanaian production sites 
      with regard to pattern of fermentation (API 50 CHL), genotype, antimicrobial
      activity, and resistance to low pH and bile salts. METHODS AND RESULTS: In total 
      215 LAB were isolated from koko and KSW. The isolates were identified using
      intergenic transcribed spacers (ITS)-PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism
      (RFLP), API 50 CHL, restriction enzyme analysis with pulsed-field gel
      electrophoresis (REA-PFGE) and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The dominating
      micro-organisms in koko was found to be Weisella confusa and Lactobacillus
      fermentum, followed by Lact. salivarius and Pediococcus spp. Chemometric data
      analysis were used to link the LAB species to the different production stages and
      production sites. At intra-species level the isolates were found to have a great 
      diversity. The isolates were investigated for antimicrobial activity using agar
      diffusion assays, and acid and bile tolerance. Most isolates showed low levels of
      antimicrobial activity towards the indicator strain Listeria innocua, but not
      towards the bacteriocin-sensitive Lact. sakei. Growth of all LAB isolates was
      unaffected by the presence of 0.3% (v/v) oxgall bile. The isolates were able to
      survive, but were not able to grow in growth medium adjusted to pH 2.5.
      CONCLUSIONS: The dominating LAB of koko and KSW were W. confusa and Lact.
      fermentum showing a pronounced taxonomic biodiversity at sub-species level
      between stages within the production as well as between production sites. Other
      species observed in KSW were Lact. salivarius, Ped. pentosaceus, Ped.
      acidilactici and Lact. paraplantarum. They occurred in levels of 108 CFU ml-1 in 
      fresh KSW and showed uniform antimicrobial activity, and acid and bile tolerance.
      SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The present study gives a detailed picture 
      of the taxonomy and diversity of LAB in an African-fermented millet product that 
      may have potential as a probiotic product for the local population. The
      chemometric tools Principal Component Analysis and anova Partial Least Squares
      Regression were proven to be useful in the analysis of microbial groupings and
      associations with specific sites and stages in the production of koko and KSW.

TI  - The Arabidopsis double-stranded RNA-binding protein HYL1 plays a role in
      microRNA-mediated gene regulation.
PG  - 1093-8
AB  - The Arabidopsis HYL1 gene encodes a nuclear double-stranded RNA-binding protein. 
      A knockout mutation of the hyl1 gene is recessive and pleiotropic, causing
      developmental abnormalities, increasing sensitivity to abscisic acid, and
      reducing sensitivity to auxin and cytokinin. We report that levels of several
      microRNAs (miRNAs; miR159, -167, and -171) are reduced in homozygous mutant
      plants, and levels of two of three tested target mRNAs are elevated. Conversely, 
      the miRNA levels are elevated in plants expressing a HYL1 cDNA from a strong
      promoter, and the corresponding target RNAs are reduced. These changes result
      from alterations in the stability of the target RNAs. However, double-stranded
      RNA-induced posttranscriptional gene silencing is unaffected by the hyl1
      mutation. One-third to one-half of the cellular HYL1 protein is in a
      macromolecular complex, and a GFP-HYL1 fusion protein is found predominantly in
      the nucleus, although it is observed in both nucleus and cytoplasm in some cells.
      Within nuclei, HYL1 is associated with subnuclear bodies and ring-like
      structures. These observations provide evidence that the HYL1 protein is part of 
      a nuclear macromolecular complex that is involved in miRNA-mediated gene
      regulation. Because hyl1 mutants show marked abnormalities in hormone responses, 
      these results further suggest that miRNA-mediated changes in mRNA stability play 
      a vital role in plant hormone signaling.

TI  - Specific histone tail modification and not DNA methylation is a determinant of
      herpes simplex virus type 1 latent gene expression.
PG  - 1139-49
AB  - During herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) latency, gene expression is tightly
      repressed except for the latency-associated transcript (LAT). The mechanistic
      basis for this repression is unknown, but its global nature suggests regulation
      by an epigenetic mechanism such as DNA methylation. Previous work demonstrated
      that latent HSV-1 genomes are not extensively methylated, but these studies
      lacked the resolution to examine methylation of individual CpGs that could
      repress transcription from individual promoters during latency. To address this
      point, we employed established models to predict genomic regions with the highest
      probability of being methylated and, using bisulfite sequencing, analyzed the
      methylation profiles of these regions. We found no significant methylation of
      latent DNA isolated from mouse dorsal root ganglia in any of the regions
      examined, including the ICP4 and LAT promoters. This analysis indicates that
      methylation is unlikely to play a major role in regulating HSV-1 latent gene
      expression. Subsequently we focused on differential histone modification as
      another epigenetic mechanism that could regulate latent transcription. Chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation analysis of the latent HSV-1 DNA repeat regions demonstrated 
      that a portion of the LAT region is associated with histone H3 acetylated at
      lysines 9 and 14, consistent with a euchromatic and nonrepressed structure. In
      contrast, the chromatin associated with the HSV-1 DNA polymerase gene located in 
      the unique long segment was not enriched in H3 acetylated at lysines 9 and 14,
      suggesting a transcriptionally inactive structure. These data suggest that
      histone composition may be a major regulatory determinant of HSV latency.

TI  - Cyclin A correlates with the sensitivity of human cancer cells to cytotoxic
      effects of 5-FU.
PG  - 273-8
AB  - We investigated the role of cyclin A in the cytotoxic effect of 5-fluorouracil
      (5-FU) on cancer cell lines. Experiments were performed using gastric cancer
      chemosensitive NUGC3, and chemoresistant NUGC3/5FU/L established by repeated
      exposure to 5-FU. 5-FU inhibited cell growth of NUGC3 in a dose-dependent manner.
      Low concentrations of 5-FU did not inhibit cell growth of NUGC3/5FU/L, while high
      concentrations slightly inhibited cell growth. Examination of the cell cycle
      pattern of NUGC3 cells showed accumulation at S-phase at 10 micro M and at
      G1-S-phase at 100 micro M of 5-FU. Cell cycle pattern of NUGC3/5FU/L cells did
      not change 5-FU concentrations. 5-FU increased cyclin A mRNA level in NUGC3 cells
      but not NUGC3/5FU/L cells. In the presence of 100 micro M 5-FU, cyclin A protein 
      level increased 2.6-fold in NUGC3 and 1.47-fold in NUGC3/5FU/L. 5-FU
      dose-dependently increased the percentage of cyclin A-positive NUGC3 cells, but
      not NUGC3/5FU/L cells. The percentage of cyclin A-positive cells in other 5-FU
      sensitive esophageal, colon and gastric cancer cell lines (T.Tn, LOVO, DLD-1,
      MKN-7), increased in the presence of 1 and 10 micro M 5-FU, while cyclin
      A-positive cells in 5-FU resitant hepatocellular and colon carcinoma cell lines
      (HCC50 and C-1), did not increase with the same treatment. Our results indicate
      that the cytotoxic effects of 5-FU in human cancer cell lines correlate with
      cyclin A and it may be used as a predictive factor for chemotherapy response.

TI  - Sequence-specific gene silencing in murine muscle induced by
      electroporation-mediated transfer of short interfering RNA.
PG  - 105-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Post-genomic biomedical research requires efficient techniques for
      functional analyses of poorly characterized genes in living organisms.
      Sequence-specific gene silencing in mammalian organs may provide valuable
      information on the physiological and pathological roles of predicted genes in
      mammalian systems. Here, we attempted targeted gene knockdown in vivo in murine
      skeletal muscle through the electroporation-mediated transfer of short
      interfering RNA (siRNA). METHODS: siRNA duplexes corresponding to the firefly
      luciferase (Luc), green fluorescent protein (GFP), or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate 
      dehydrogenase (GAPD) genes were delivered by electroporation into the tibial
      muscle of normal or enhanced GFP (EGFP) transgenic mice. Plasmid vectors carrying
      the Luc, hRluc or beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) reporter genes were also
      delivered. The Luc and hRluc activities in the muscle lysates were assayed. The
      EGFP and GAPD expression was detected by fluorescence microscopic observation and
      RT-PCR, respectively. RESULTS: When Luc-specific siRNA was co-delivered with the 
      Luc expression vector into the tibial muscle, the reporter gene expression was
      markedly suppressed (less than 1% of the control level) for 5 days. As little as 
      0.05 micro g of siRNA almost completely blocked the reporter gene expression from
      10 micro g of the plasmid. To examine whether siRNA can also suppress expression 
      of an endogenous gene, transgenic mice carrying the EGFP gene received
      intramuscular transfection of a mixture of beta-gal plasmid and GFP-specific
      siRNA. beta-Gal-positive cells failed to express detectable levels of EGFP, while
      EGFP expression was not inhibited in control mice that received nonspecific
      siRNA. Expression of GAPD was also suppressed by the specific siRNA. CONCLUSIONS:
      The present system may provide a useful means of phenotypic analysis of genetic
      information in mammalian organs for basic research as well as therapeutic
      molecular targeting in the post-genomic era.

TI  - Low specificity of blood thyroglobulin messenger ribonucleic acid assay prevents 
      its use in the follow-up of differentiated thyroid cancer patients.
PG  - 33-9
AB  - Thyroglobulin (Tg) is a glycoprotein specifically synthesized by follicular
      thyroid epithelium. After thyroidectomy and remnant (131)I ablation, serum Tg is 
      a specific and sensitive marker for the presence of thyroid cancer tissue, and
      its measurement is fundamental in the follow-up of patients affected by
      differentiated thyroid carcinomas (DTCs), being even more sensitive than
      diagnostic whole-body scan. Unfortunately, serum Tg measurement becomes useless
      in approximately 15-25% of DTC cases who are positive for anti-Tg antibodies that
      interfere with the Tg measurement. In these cases, Tg mRNA measurement has been
      proposed as an alternative to serum Tg determination. The aim of this study was
      to verify the sensitivity and specificity of Tg mRNA measurement, performed by
      quantitative real-time RT-PCR, in a series of 100 subjects (80 DTC patients and
      20 controls). From our data, the sensitivity and the specificity of the blood Tg 
      mRNA measurement are 82.3 and 24.2%, respectively, with a positive predictive
      value and a negative predictive value of 65.6 and 43.7%, respectively. The
      comparison of the Tg mRNA with the serum Tg, measured by both chemiluminescent
      and ultrasensitive ELISA methods, confirmed the low specificity of the Tg mRNA
      assay. The hypothesis that Tg mRNA detectable levels could be predictive of
      future recurrences is not supported by the long follow-up (median, 7 yr; range,
      3-29 yr) of our disease-free patients, who did not develop any recurrences in
      their clinical history. Moreover, nine disease-free patients, who showed positive
      levels of Tg mRNA (11.8-336 pg equivalents/ micro g RNA), were confirmed to be
      serum Tg free, both in basal conditions and after recombinant human TSH
      stimulation, 4 yr after the Tg mRNA detection. In conclusion, we demonstrated
      that the Tg mRNA assay is of poor utility in the follow-up of DTC patients. On
      the contrary, serum Tg measurement is a very sensitive and specific thyroid tumor
      marker, and we recommend that the follow-up of patients affected by DTC must be
      performed using serum Tg rather than blood Tg mRNA measurement.

TI  - Cultivation and growth characteristics of a diverse group of oligotrophic marine 
      Gammaproteobacteria.
PG  - 432-40
AB  - Forty-four novel strains of Gammaproteobacteria were cultivated from coastal and 
      pelagic regions of the Pacific Ocean using high-throughput culturing methods that
      rely on dilution to extinction in very low nutrient media. Phylogenetic analysis 
      showed that the isolates fell into five rRNA clades, all of which contained rRNA 
      gene sequences reported previously from seawater environmental gene clone
      libraries (SAR92, OM60, OM182, BD1-7, and KI89A). Bootstrap analyses of
      phylogenetic reliability did not support collapsing these five clades into a
      single clade, and they were therefore named the oligotrophic marine
      Gammaproteobacteria (OMG) group. Twelve cultures chosen to represent the five
      clades were successively purified in liquid culture, and their growth
      characteristics were determined at different temperatures and dissolved organic
      carbon concentrations. The isolates in the OMG group were physiologically diverse
      heterotrophs, and their physiological properties generally followed their
      phylogenetic relationships. None of the isolates in the OMG group formed colonies
      on low- or high-nutrient agar upon their first isolation from seawater, while 7
      of 12 isolates that were propagated for laboratory testing eventually produced
      colonies on 1/10 R2A agar. The isolates grew relatively slowly in natural
      seawater media (1.23 to 2.63 day(-1)), and none of them grew in high-nutrient
      media (>351 mg of C liter(-1)). The isolates were psychro- to mesophilic and
      obligately oligotrophic; many of them were of ultramicrobial size (<0.1 micro
      m(3)). This cultivation study revealed that sporadically detected
      Gammaproteobacteria gene clones from seawater are part of a phylogenetically
      diverse constellation of organisms mainly composed of oligotrophic and
      ultramicrobial lineages that are culturable under specific cultivation
      conditions.

TI  - Biochemical and genetic interaction between the fragile X mental retardation
      protein and the microRNA pathway.
PG  - 113-7
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is caused by a loss of expression of the fragile X mental
      retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP is a selective RNA-binding protein which forms a
      messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complex that associates with polyribosomes.
      Recently, mRNA ligands associated with FMRP have been identified. However, the
      mechanism by which FMRP regulates the translation of its mRNA ligands remains
      unclear. MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs involved in translational control.
      Here we show that in vivo mammalian FMRP interacts with microRNAs and the
      components of the microRNA pathways including Dicer and the mammalian ortholog of
      Argonaute 1 (AGO1). Using two different Drosophila melanogaster models, we show
      that AGO1 is critical for FMRP function in neural development and synaptogenesis.
      Our results suggest that FMRP may regulate neuronal translation via microRNAs and
      links microRNAs with human disease.

TI  - The prognostic significance of thymidine phosphorylase, thymidylate synthase and 
      dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase mRNA expressions in breast carcinomas.
PG  - 129-36
AB  - Thymidine phosphorylase (TP), thymidylate synthase (TS) and dihydropyrimidine
      dehydrogenase (DPD) have been indicated as possible predictive markers for
      epithelial malignancies. All these three enzymes are actively involved in 5-FU
      metabolism. In this report, we investigated mRNA expression of these factors with
      real-time quantitative PCR in a series of 86 micro-selected breast carcinomas and
      8 micro-selected tumour-adjacent normal breast epithelial specimens. Highly
      variable mRNA expressions of these factors were observed in both normal and
      cancerous samples. TP and TS mRNA expressions in breast carcinomas were elevated,
      but only TS mRNA expression showed a trend for statistical difference, compared
      with the expression in normal breast epithelial samples. Although the DPD mRNA
      expression range in tumours was also elevated, the average mean was reduced in
      tumours compared to that in normal samples. No association between mRNA
      expressions of TP, TS and DPD and clinicopathological features such as
      histological grade, tumour size, node status, S-phase fraction, ploidy, and
      clinical stage was found. A negative association between DPD mRNA expression and 
      age was, however, revealed. Ten-year follow-up analysis showed no association
      between TP and DPD mRNA expression and clinical outcome. An high level of TS mRNA
      expression, however, was associated with a shorter clinical survival, indicating 
      its potential role as a clinical marker in breast carcinoma.

TI  - Measurement of gene expression in archival paraffin-embedded tissues: development
      and performance of a 92-gene reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
      assay.
PG  - 35-42
AB  - Throughout the last decade many laboratories have shown that mRNA levels in
      formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FPE) tissue specimens can be quantified by 
      reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques despite the
      extensive RNA fragmentation that occurs in tissues so preserved. We have
      developed RT-PCR methods that are sensitive, precise, and that have multianalyte 
      capability for potential wide use in clinical research and diagnostic assays.
      Here it is shown that the extent of fragmentation of extracted FPE tissue RNA
      significantly increases with archive storage time. Probe and primer sets for
      RT-PCR assays based on amplicons that are both short and homogeneous in length
      enable effective reference gene-based data normalization for cross comparison of 
      specimens that differ substantially in age. A 48-gene assay used to compare gene 
      expression profiles from the same breast cancer tissue that had been either
      frozen or FPE showed very similar profiles after reference gene-based
      normalization. A 92-gene assay, using RNA extracted from three 10- micro m FPE
      sections of archival breast cancer specimens (dating from 1985 to 2001) yielded
      analyzable data for these genes in all 62 tested specimens. The results were
      substantially concordant when estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 
      receptor status determined by RT-PCR was compared with immunohistochemistry
      assays for these receptors. Furthermore, the results highlight the advantages of 
      RT-PCR over immunohistochemistry with respect to quantitation and dynamic range. 
      These findings support the development of RT-PCR analysis of FPE tissue RNA as a 
      platform for multianalyte clinical diagnostic tests.

TI  - Identification of many microRNAs that copurify with polyribosomes in mammalian
      neurons.
PG  - 360-5
AB  - Localized translation in mammalian dendrites may play a role in synaptic
      plasticity and contribute to the molecular basis for learning and memory. The
      regulatory mechanisms that control localized translation in neurons are not well 
      understood. We propose a role for microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of noncoding RNAs, 
      as mediators of neuronal translational regulation. We have identified 86 miRNAs
      expressed in mammalian neurons, of which 40 have not previously been reported. A 
      subset of these miRNAs exhibits temporally regulated expression in cortical
      cultures. Moreover, all of the miRNAs that were tested cofractionate with
      polyribosomes, the sites of active translation. These findings indicate that a
      large, diverse population of miRNAs may function to regulate translation in
      mammalian neurons.

TI  - HSV LAT and neuronal survival.
PG  - 187-98
AB  - Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) establishes a latent infection within sensory neurons 
      and periodically reactivates in response to stress. HSV's ability to inhabit
      neurons for the life of the host involves a number of virally encoded functions
      that tightly regulate the latency-reactivation cycle, preventing uncontrolled
      spread of reactivating virus and large-scale death of neurons. The HSV
      latency-associated transcript (LAT) is a complex transcription unit expressed
      primarily in neurons containing latent genomes. While mutational analyses
      indicate LAT is nonessential for viral replication, the 5' exon of LAT greatly
      enhances reactivation. Several studies have also identified LAT mutations that
      reduce establishment of latency and enhance virulence. Recently, LAT has also
      been shown to inhibit cell death through by blocking caspase-8 and caspase-9
      pathways. While blocking apoptosis is not essential for either establishment of
      latency or reactivation, it likely augments these processes and may contribute to
      HSV's long-term persistence and spread.

TI  - Neuronal types expressing mu- and delta-opioid receptor mRNA in the rat
      hippocampal formation.
PG  - 107-18
AB  - Opioids are thought to control the excitability of hippocampal principal neurons 
      indirectly by inhibiting GABAergic interneurons. However, direct inhibition of
      hippocampal principal neurons by opioids has also been reported. To understand
      better the neuromodulatory role of opioids in rat hippocampal circuits, we
      analyzed types of micro- and delta-opioid receptor (MOR, DOR)-expressing
      hippocampal neurons. Most MOR-immunoreactive neurons in the granular and
      pyramidal cell layers exhibited multipolar morphologies characteristic of
      GABAergic neurons. Virtually all neurons in the hippocampal formation expressing 
      high MOR mRNA levels cocontained the mRNA for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). 
      Most parvalbumin-, several calretinin-, and several pre-proenkephalin-containing 
      neurons expressed the MOR gene in the hippocampal formation. Expression of high
      DOR mRNA levels was restricted to GAD-positive neurons in the principal cell
      layers, oriens layer and hilus. More than 90% of the parvalbumin-positive neurons
      in the hippocampal formation strongly expressed the DOR gene. Granule cells
      expressing vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) mRNA contained very low MOR
      and DOR transcript levels. In VGLUT1-positive pyramidal cells, weak DOR but no
      MOR gene expression was detected. Whereas most somatostatinergic hilar neurons
      were negative for MOR and DOR mRNA, somatostatinergic oriens layer neurons
      frequently expressed these receptors. Taken together, weak expression of MOR and 
      DOR genes in hippocampal principal cells is in concordance with direct
      opioid-mediated inhibition of principal cells. However, strong expression of the 
      MOR and DOR genes in the hippocampus is restricted to gamma-aminobutyric acid
      (GABA)ergic neurons, with DORs being selectively expressed in the parvalbumin-
      and somatostatin-containing subpopulations. Activation of MOR and/or DOR in
      parvalbumin- and somatostatin-containing neurons, which provide GABAergic
      inhibition to the perisomatic and distal dendritic regions of principal cells,
      respectively, is likely to facilitate principal cell excitation.

TI  - IFN-inducible protein 10/CXC chemokine ligand 10-independent induction of
      experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.
PG  - 550-9
AB  - In multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune
      encephalomyelitis (EAE), autoaggressive T cells traffic into the CNS and induce
      disease. Infiltration of these pathogenic T cells into the CNS has been
      correlated with the expression of the chemokine IFN-inducible protein (IP)10/CXC 
      chemokine ligand (CXCL)10, a chemoattractant for activated T cells, and its
      receptor CXCR3, in the CNS of both MS patients and mice with EAE. In the present 
      study, we report that targeted deletion of IP-10 did not diminish the expression,
      severity, or histopathology of EAE induced by active immunization with 100 micro 
      g of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide (MOG)p35-55. However, we found
      that IP-10-deficient mice had a lower threshold for expression of disease
      compared with wild-type littermates. EAE induced by immunization with 5 micro g
      of MOGp35-55 resulted in more severe disease characterized by a greater number of
      CNS lesions and infiltrating mononuclear cells in IP-10-deficient mice compared
      with wild-type controls. IP-10-deficient mice immunized with MOGp35-55
      demonstrated increased levels of IFN-inducible T cell alpha-chemokine/CXCL11 mRNA
      in the CNS and decreased levels of monokine induced by IFN-gamma/CXCL9 mRNA in
      draining lymph nodes, suggesting differential compensation for loss of IP-10 in
      lymphoid vs parenchymal tissue compartments. EAE in IP-10-deficient mice induced 
      by low-dose immunization was associated with enhanced Ag-specific Th1 responses
      in the draining lymph node, which corresponded with diminished lymph node
      TGF-beta1 expression. Our data demonstrated that IP-10 was not required for the
      trafficking of pathogenic T cells into the CNS in EAE but played an unexpected
      role in determining the threshold of disease susceptibility in the periphery.

TI  - Activation of m-calpain is required for chromosome alignment on the metaphase
      plate during mitosis.
PG  - 10615-23
AB  - Calpains form a superfamily of Ca(2+)-dependent intracellular cysteine proteases 
      with various isoforms. Two isoforms, micro- and m-calpains, are ubiquitously
      expressed and known as conventional calpains. It has been previously shown that
      the mammalian calpains are activated during mitosis by transient increases in
      cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration. However, it is still unknown whether the
      activation of calpains contributes to particular events in mitosis. With the use 
      of RNA interference (RNAi), we investigated the roles of calpains in mitosis.
      Cells reduced the levels of m-calpain, but not mu-calpain, arrested at
      prometaphase and failed to align their chromosomes at the spindle equator.
      Specific peptidyl calpain inhibitors also induced aberrant mitosis with
      chromosome misalignment. Although both m-calpain RNAi and calpain inhibitors
      affected neither the separation of centrosomes nor the assembly of bipolar
      spindles, Mad2 was detected on the kinetochores of the misaligned chromosomes,
      indicating that the prometaphase arrest induced by calpain inhibition is due to
      activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint. Furthermore, when calpain activity
      was inhibited in cells having monopolar spindles, chromosomes were clustered
      adjacent to the centrosome, suggesting that calpain activity is involved in a
      polar ejection force for metaphase alignment of chromosomes. Based on these
      findings, we propose that activation of m-calpain during mitosis is required for 
      cells to establish the chromosome alignment by regulating some molecules that
      generate polar ejection force.

TI  - Seasonal variation of organogenetic activity and reserves allocation in the shoot
      apex of Pinus pinaster Ait.
PG  - 25-37
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To understand better the basic growth characteristics of
      pines and the fundamental properties of the shoot apical meristem (SAM),
      variations within the shoot apex of buds were studied. METHODS: A detailed
      structural comparison of meristem dimensions, organogenetic activity, and the
      presence of lipids, starch grains and tannins was performed on shoot apices of
      juvenile, and male and female adult Pinus pinaster at five different times in the
      annual growth cycle. KEY RESULTS: There were significant correlations among
      traits and differences in the pattern for juvenile and adult shoots. In juvenile 
      shoots, peaks of organogenesis were present in spring and autumn, but not in
      summer. In adult shoots, one peak, characterized by an increase in meristem
      dimensions, was present in summer. The accumulation of starch grains beneath the 
      SAM and of tannin in sub-apical pith parenchyma were at their maximum when
      organogenetic activity was high in spring and autumn in juvenile plants, and in
      summer in adult plants. In juvenile and adult plants, lipids were stored within
      the SAM in autumn, filling a large part of the bud in winter, and were depleted
      in the cortical parenchyma and then in the pith during shoot elongation.
      CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the sites of accumulation within the SAM and on the
      stage of the annual growth cycle, lipids, starch and tannins may be involved in
      different processes. In spring, energy and structural materials released by lipid
      hydrolysis may contribute to stem elongation and/or cell-to-cell communication.
      During organogenesis, energy and structural materials released by starch
      hydrolysis may influence developmental programmes in the SAM and adjacent cells. 
      Tannins may be involved in cellular detoxification. At the end of the growing
      season, accumulation of lipid and starch is positively correlated with the onset 
      of dormancy.

TI  - Phylogenetic analysis and in situ identification of the intestinal microbial
      community of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss, Walbaum).
PG  - 117-32
AB  - AIMS: To identify the dominant culturable and nonculturable microbiota of rainbow
      trout intestine. METHODS AND RESULTS: Microbial density of rainbow trout
      intestine was estimated by direct microscopic counts
      (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, DAPI) and by culturing on tryptone soya agar
      (TSA). Differential gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of bacterial DNA from
      intestinal samples, re-amplification of bands and sequence analysis was used to
      identify the bacteria that dominated samples where aerobic counts were < or =2%
      of the DAPI counts. 16S rDNA gene sequences of 146 bacterial isolates and three
      sequences of uncultured bacteria were identified. A set of oligonucleotide probes
      was constructed and used to detect and enumerate the bacterial community
      structure of the gastrointestinal tract of rainbow trout by fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization (FISH). Members of the gamma subclass of Proteobacteria (mainly
      Aeromonas and Enterobacteriaceae) dominated the bacterial population structure.
      Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Shewanella, Plesiomonas and Proteus were also
      identified together with isolates belonging to the beta subclass of
      Proteobacteria and Gram-positive bacteria with high and low DNA G + C content. In
      most samples, the aerobic count (on TSA) was 50-90% of the direct (DAPI) count. A
      bacterium representing a previously unknown phylogenetic lineage with only 89%
      16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to Anaerofilum pentosovorans was detected in
      intestinal samples where aerobic counts were < or =2% of direct (DAPI) counts.
      Ten to 75% of the microbial population in samples with low aerobic counts
      hybridized (FISH) with a probe constructed against this not-yet cultured
      bacterium. CONCLUSIONS: Proteobacteria belonging to the gamma subclass dominated 
      the intestinal microbiota of rainbow trout. However, in some samples the
      microflora was dominated by uncultivated, presumed anaerobic, micro-organisms.
      The bacterial population structure of rainbow trout intestine, as well as total
      bacterial counts, varied from fish to fish. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY:
      Good correlation was seen between cultivation results and in situ analysis,
      however, a molecular approach was crucial for the identification of organisms
      uncultivated on TSA.

TI  - MicroRNAs modulate hematopoietic lineage differentiation.
PG  - 83-6
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of approximately 22-nucleotide
      regulatory RNAs found in plants and animals. Some miRNAs of plants,
      Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila play important gene-regulatory roles
      during development by pairing to target mRNAs to specify posttranscriptional
      repression of these messages. We identify three miRNAs that are specifically
      expressed in hematopoietic cells and show that their expression is dynamically
      regulated during early hematopoiesis and lineage commitment. One of these miRNAs,
      miR-181, was preferentially expressed in the B-lymphoid cells of mouse bone
      marrow, and its ectopic expression in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells led to 
      an increased fraction of B-lineage cells in both tissue-culture differentiation
      assays and adult mice. Our results indicate that microRNAs are components of the 
      molecular circuitry that controls mouse hematopoiesis and suggest that other
      microRNAs have similar regulatory roles during other facets of vertebrate
      development.

TI  - Bile acids induce cyclooxygenase-2 expression in human pancreatic cancer cell
      lines.
PG  - 419-23
AB  - To investigate a possible link between bile acids and the pathogenesis of
      pancreatic cancer, we determined whether conjugated or unconjugated bile acids
      induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in two human pancreatic cancer cell lines,
      BxPC-3 and SU 86.86. Bile acids are known promoters of gastric and colon cancer. 
      We demonstrated previously that COX-2, an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of 
      prostaglandins, is over-expressed in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Both human 
      pancreatic cell lines were treated with conjugated and unconjugated bile acids.
      COX-2 mRNA and protein were determined. In addition, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)
      synthesis was measured. Treatment with conjugated or unconjugated bile acids for 
      3 h up-regulated COX-2 mRNA. Chenodeoxycholate (CD) or deoxycholate at
      concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 100 micro M caused a dose-dependent induction
      of COX-2 protein with a maximal effect at 100 micro M. Induction of COX-2 protein
      by CD and deoxycholate was detected after treatment for 6 h with maximal
      induction at 12 h. Taurochenodeoxycholate, a conjugated bile acid, also caused
      dose-dependent induction of COX-2 but higher concentrations of bile acid
      (200-1200 micro M) were required. Levels of cyclooxygenase-1 were unaffected by
      bile acid treatment. Unconjugated and conjugated bile acids caused 7- and 4-fold 
      increases in PGE2 production, respectively. Taken together, these findings
      suggest a possible role for bile acids in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer.

TI  - Humoral immune response to p53 correlates with clinical course in colorectal
      cancer patients during adjuvant chemotherapy.
PG  - 114-20
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Overexpression of p53 protein in malignancies induces an
      immune response in some cancer patients. We investigated whether production of
      serum antibodies against p53 (p53-Ab) is associated with pathohistological
      parameters of colorectal carcinoma and whether p53-Ab can serve as a tumor marker
      during cancer treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum samples from 220 colorectal 
      cancer patients during surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy and 42 healthy controls 
      were tested for the presence of p53-Ab by ELISA. Expression of p53 protein in
      tumors was determined using mouse anti-human p53-Ab. RESULTS: Serum p53-Ab were
      detected in 18% of patients while all controls were negative. A strong
      correlation between p53-Ab production and p53 protein expression was observed:
      70% of p53-Ab positive cases had tumors positive for p53 vs. 52% of p53-Ab
      negative cases. There was also a significant predominance of p53-Ab positive
      cases in Dukes' stages B and C over stage A. Although surgery alone reduced
      p53-Ab levels, decreases in p53-Ab titer became significant midterm through
      chemotherapy compared to both pre- and postoperative values and remained
      decreased until the completion of treatment. CONCLUSION: The presence of p53-Ab
      in sera of patients with colorectal cancer indicates tumors in more advanced
      histopathologic stages (Dukes' B, C). Due to low sensitivity (18%) p53-Ab are not
      recommendable as a preoperative marker for colorectal cancer. However, due to
      high specificity (100%), their monitoring after surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy
      has potential for early diagnosis of tumor relapse in p53-Ab positive cases.

TI  - Nuclear export of microRNA precursors.
PG  - 95-8
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which function as regulators of gene expression in
      eukaryotes, are processed from larger transcripts by sequential action of nuclear
      and cytoplasmic ribonuclease III-like endonucleases. We show that Exportin-5
      (Exp5) mediates efficient nuclear export of short miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs)
      and that its depletion by RNA interference results in reduced miRNA levels. Exp5 
      binds correctly processed pre-miRNAs directly and specifically, in a Ran
      guanosine triphosphate-dependent manner, but interacts only weakly with extended 
      pre-miRNAs that yield incorrect miRNAs when processed by Dicer in vitro. Thus,
      Exp5 is key to miRNA biogenesis and may help coordinate nuclear and cytoplasmic
      processing steps.

TI  - The hepatocellular bile acid transporter Ntcp facilitates uptake of the lethal
      mushroom toxin alpha-amanitin.
PG  - 68-73
AB  - Hepatotoxicity caused by the mushroom poison alpha-amanitin is an unusual but
      serious cause of death and liver transplantation. Understanding the mechanisms of
      alpha-amanitin uptake may lead to rational therapeutic approaches. Because older 
      data suggested that a sodium-dependent bile acid transporter is responsible for
      alpha-amanitin uptake, we tested the hypothesis that Na(+)-taurocholate
      cotransporter polypeptide (Ntcp) facilitates hepatocellular alpha-amanitin
      uptake. Human hepatoblastoma cells (HepG2), cells that have lost native Ntcp
      expression, were stably transfected with the rat Ntcp gene. Taurocholate uptake
      by the transfected cells exhibited a physiologically normal K(m) and V(max). A
      toxicologically relevant functional assay for alpha-amanitin uptake was developed
      by measuring its ability to block cytokine-induced synthesis of interleukin-1
      receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) mRNA. Treatment with interleukin-1beta (10 ng/ml)
      and interleukin-6 (100 ng/ml) increased IL-1Ra mRNA abundance 8.6-fold and
      15.6-fold in HepG2 cells and Ntcp-transfected cells, respectively. Pretreatment
      of transfected cells with 1 micro M alpha-amanitin for 6-10 h almost completely
      blocked induction of IL-1Ra mRNA (1.9-fold induction) whereas pretreatment of
      non-transfected cells did not block induction of IL-1Ra mRNA (21.6-fold
      induction, P<0.02 compared with stimulated transfected cells without
      alpha-amanitin). These findings demonstrate that Ntcp may be an important
      mediator of alpha-amanitin uptake by the liver.

TI  - P-glycoprotein expression does not change the apoptotic pathway induced by
      curcumin in HL-60 cells.
PG  - 179-85
AB  - PURPOSE: One of the mechanisms responsible for the multidrug resistance (MDR)
      phenotype of cancer cells is overexpression of so-called ATP-dependent drug
      efflux proteins: the 170-kDa P-glycoprotein (P-gp) encoded by the MDR1 gene and
      the 190-kDa multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 encoded by the MRP1 gene.
      The purpose of the present study was to verify the hypothesis postulating that
      P-gp expression, apart from enabling drug efflux, confers on the cells resistance
      to apoptosis by inhibiting caspase-8 and caspase-3. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human 
      HL-60 cells, either drug-sensitive or with the MDR phenotype caused by
      overexpression of P-gp (HL-60/Vinc) or MRP1 (HL-60/Adr), were treated with the
      natural dye curcumin at 50 micro M or with UVC to induce apoptosis. Symptoms of
      cell death were assessed by morphological observation after Hoechst staining, DNA
      fragmentation was measured by flow cytometry and the TUNEL method, and caspase-8 
      and caspase-3 activation and cytochrome c release from mitochondria were measured
      by Western blotting. RESULTS: Curcumin induced cell death in HL-60 cells, both
      sensitive and with the MDR phenotype, which could be classified as
      caspase-3-dependent apoptosis, together with cytochrome c release, activation of 
      caspase-3 and oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation. No active caspase-8 was
      detected. Also UVC caused caspase-3 activation in both the sensitive and the MDR 
      HL-60 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that there was no correlation between
      P-gp expression and resistance to caspase-3-dependent apoptosis induced by
      curcumin and UVC, at least in HL-60 cells. However, we cannot exclude the
      possibility of parallel P-gp expression and caspase-3 inhibition in some other
      cell lines, as cancer cells can acquire many different apoptosis-resistance
      mechanisms.

TI  - A microRNA as a translational repressor of APETALA2 in Arabidopsis flower
      development.
PG  - 2022-5
AB  - Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) show a high degree of sequence complementarity to, and
      are believed to guide the cleavage of, their target messenger RNAs. Here, I show 
      that miRNA172, which can base-pair with the messenger RNA of a floral homeotic
      gene, APETALA2, regulates APETALA2 expression primarily through translational
      inhibition. Elevated miRNA172 accumulation results in floral organ identity
      defects similar to those in loss-of-function apetala2 mutants. Elevated levels of
      mutant APETALA2 RNA with disrupted miRNA172 base pairing, but not wild-type
      APETALA2 RNA, result in elevated levels of APETALA2 protein and severe floral
      patterning defects. Therefore, miRNA172 likely acts in cell-fate specification as
      a translational repressor of APETALA2 in Arabidopsis flower development.
